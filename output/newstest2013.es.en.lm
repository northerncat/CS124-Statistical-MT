A humble strategy for hinder the for of Obama
The leaders Republican justify their policy the need of fight against the electoral fraud .
Now well , the centre Brennan as this last a myth and says that electoral fraud is least often in the States United that number of people that die to cause of the fall of a glimmer .
Of fact , the lawyers Republican not have found more that 300 cases of electoral fraud in the States United in ten years .
A thing is certain : these new provisions will adversely to the rate of participation .
In that sense , these measures in part the democratic American system .
The contrary of what that happens in Canada , the States Americans are responsible of the organisation of the federal elections in the States United .
And in that same line a majority of the governments Americans instance , to from of 2009 , new laws that cancelled the process of for or of vote .
This phenomenon has widespread after the elections of November of 2010 , that were the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States .
In result , for the year 2011 introduced 180 projects of law that tighter the exercise the right of vote in 41 States .
The new laws election are that electorate be a document of identity with a was , also of a test of American citizenship .
other Por part , these laws reduced the periods of vote which , the right to enrol as Forrester in the day the polling and couple their right the vote to the citizens with criminal background .
Before of the elections of 2006 , no state American requirements that electorate a document of identity with was .
The state of Indiana was the first in demand .
The Court Supreme of the States United this in 2008 the being of the law of Indiana .
Por the authorities quick to extend that practice to other States .
In the last years these authorities have supported projects of law in 34 States for force to the electorate to it a document of identity with was .
Is important have in account the contrary of what that is in Quebec , the citizens Americans not have of a document of identity universal , as the card of the social security .
Of fact , a 11 % of the citizens Americans , is say , 21 million of people in age of vote , not have with no document of identity with was we an agency government of their state .
Por another on , five million of new electorate in 2012 are of a document of identity with these characteristics .
But , to often , the obtaining the document of identity delays costs more of hundred dollars .
With what which , the new restrictions affect of way much to the young , the minorities and the people with income Netherlands .
In effect , a 25 % of , a 15 % of people that earn least of 35.000 dollars the year , a 18 % of the citizens of more of 65 years and a 20 % of the electorate of between 18 and 29 years not have with a document of identity with was .
And still there more .
In many States the students , the electorate that more vote to the candidates democrats , not can use the document of identity with was we their institution .
other Por part , these ourselves States authorise to the Member of the clubs of fishing or of hunting that usually vote to the parties Republican to use the documents worldwide these clubs .
Before of 2004 no state requirements the test of citizenship for vote .
Arizona was the first state in it this demand .
Since 2011 , a dozen of States has adopted laws that are that electorate prove that are citizens Americans .
These measures for , clearly , limit the vote .
Seems be that two of every three electorate support the party democrat .
Por another on , the legislators Republican supported in 2011 certain laws that for of electorate the same day the polling in eight States .
Also , constrained the right of the people and the groups to create a service of aid to the electorate that is enrol .
These restrictions have consequences .
Por example , in the general elections of 2004 , the campaigns of for of the electorate contributed the registration of around of 10 million of citizens .
The measures taken since 2009 succeed that rate of for of new electorate out in 2010 in compared with the year 2006 .
Also , the legislators Republican adopted laws in other five States that shock the reduction the period of vote advance .
Por example , in the elections of 2008 in Florida , a 33 % of the electorate that voted advance were , while that these last not represented more a 13 % of the electorate the state .
In the case of the happening exactly what same .
These not represent more a 11 % of the electorate , what that is to a 24 % of the citizens that vote advance .
Sin however , the white , that represent a 76 % the electorate , not represent more that 46 % of the citizens that vote advance .
Por course , the legislators democrats and their supporters have theories desire to the adoption of laws that party the registration of electorate .
In this sense , the governors democrats have blocked several projects of law .
The Ministry tax of the States United intervened for decision the laws more controversial .
Se could , in part , limit the damage .
Por example , so only 16 of 34 States adopted the law that requirements the presentation of a document of identity with was .
Sin however , is undeniable that new rules taken the exercise the right to vote in 2012 .
The critical democrats it the nature partisan of the laws that have voted , already that is clear that with them to influence in the results of 2012 in the key States .
A report the centre Brennan of 2011 shows that States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 necessary votes in the electoral school for achieve the Presidency .
Is too soon for that with certainty if these legislative amendments to at of electoral system will an significant impact in the results of the presidential elections of 2012 .
A thing is certain : these new provisions will adversely to the rate of participation .
In this sense , the measures in part the democratic American system .
Detection the cancer of prostate : done the test or not apprising ?
In effect , the test of PSA is , in times , results definite , with counterfeit negative results or even counterfeit positive results , after the decided to medical speeches so .
Is a reason more that enough for to doubt to the men , already of , on if should done or not the tests of detection .
Done the test or not ?
We asked Council to two specialists .
In the studies by in the States United was a great rate of as between the groups of shows , what that is difficult interpret these data and to recommendations firm .
Por their part , the study European was certain difference of mortality between the patients that had done the detection and the not .
The study , with a monitoring to the 12 years , proved also that there between the 30 and the 40 % of for of chronically assessment if not has done the test of detection .
Recommend , therefore , the test to from of the 50 years , or to from of the 40 years if your father has suffered cancer of prostate .
The men of origin have a rate of risk more high .
The key is take a good decision a time been the cancer .
There aggressive cancers and other cancers that are .
Is truly necessary achieve that patient understood the degree of risk of their cancer . Se you must offer all the possible options and not necessarily try the cancers of prostate that not cases against the life to long term , in whose case must has more well a active surveillance of the disease .
Today in many day men to the them has been a cancer not are treaties , since that said cancer is not aggressive not one risk for their life .
In their place , them we a active surveillance of the disease and , if this onus , them we a treatment .
Determinamos every time with more often criteria precise for decide who should or not be Treaty .
Recommend that do the test in any case .
But is important that about with their doctor for determine if must done the test or not .
Movember has created , in collaboration with the society international of Urología , a tool that allows assess the pros and the pros the test of PSA .

Prevent the disease
Unfortunately , not there a recipe miracle for prevent the cancer .
To despite of the progress of the research , the adoption of habits of life made are being the better way of reduce the risks of have the disease .
Believe that if all the world well and certainly what enough , could prevent a 30 % of the cancers .
&quot; if nobody smoke , that rate rise , the least , the 50 % &quot; , underlines André Beaulieu , spokesman of the society Canadian against the cancer .
In change , that around the 10 % of the cancers are as .
Many other are being completely explainable .
For the Canadian society against the cancer , the fight against the smoking still being a priority to despite of the in the number of smokers .
The tobacco is with with the 85 % of the cases the cancer of lung .
Is , also , a factor of risk for other types of cancers .
It us the health of the people .
&quot; today today , still there 1.5 million of smokers in Quebec &quot; , declared the spokesman André Beaulieu .
A fact hopeful : 10 years after of to of smoking , the risk of die of cancer reduces to the half .
The weight
The and the obesity by also the emergence of the disease , according the SCC .
Poorly the risks of cancer of breast , of bowel and of totally , of nitrates , of and of womb .
&quot; the research shown that practice regulate of physical activity for whole the life it against the cancer of breast &quot; , in .
The food
The Agency should , also , limit the consumption of it red .
In large quantities , do ladder the risks of have a cancer colorectal .
The products of also must avoided .
The preservation of the meat for their , fodder or herrings can to the training of carcinogenic substances .
&quot; can damage the cells the Agency and to the development the cancer &quot; , we for .
The vitamins
In the last years , several scientists have examined the links between the complex vitamin and the cancer .
Sin however , the time their research not are bombing .
Segú the SCC , the studies about of the osteoporosis and are contradictory .
While that in one of them discovered a in of the risks of cancer of prostate , in another what that observed was , more well , an increase .
The effect of the osteoporosis D in the cancer not has been determine with clarity .
other Por part , M. Beaulieu should in the importance of about on the concerns and the background family of every one with their doctor .
&quot; to the test of detection not from cancer . &quot;
The of Higgs in detail
The announcement the likely discovery the of Higgs resounding a great shock the last summer , and with reason .
Se believes , in effect , that is involve the responsible mechanism of the mass of all what that there in the universe , nothing more and nothing least .
And what that is more , is of the whose existence snowfalls the model standard : our better or &quot; bad least &quot; explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the on , that still not has been seen economically .
But for the physical is not completely clear that involved of Higgs .
We place to doubt that there a new and that seems a of Higgs predicted the model standard .
Also , new data this week in an important Congress of physical fact in Kyoto seem confirm that what is , although still more data for be completely insurance .
Of all ways , we that is of Higgs , already that for of get seem few . will of what is .
There , in this great world , a law widespread and vital that means that two things not can is in the same place the same time .
Not there way of infringing that rule and not what trying too , because will governing damage .
Although the physical of the particles be a world very complex , has shown that also in she there a law of these characteristics : the principle of exclusion of Pauli , that stipulates that two particles not can should the same space the same time if are in the same &quot; state &quot; ; a &quot; state &quot; that certain , unity way , of some of their characteristics .
The physical classify the particles in two categories .
Por a part we with the good citizens called , that supporting wisely the principle of Pauli .
And other are a laundry bunch of that not has respect nothing , or the least not this principle , what that means that can is in the same place and the same time .
According the indeed website the Particle Adventure of the laboratories Berkeley that , true , is extraordinary , the into in two groups : the restaurateurs , of the we not .ere , and the &quot; particles of force &quot; , the large forces of the nature spreading and with the which the of Higgs would of any way .
These , be stress here , not are the we believe .
Of fact , if by read this of , is thank to an extremely trivial : the or the &quot; of light &quot; that it as &quot; shoot &quot; of the electromagnetic force .
In effect , when a with a burden we accelerates or time of direction , &quot; &quot; the field in that be environment ; a little as when we a stone to a hole .
In this &quot; at &quot; stems a electromagnetic wavelength ( of the light , of the infrared , of the appalling , etc. ) , and this wavelength is not other thing a ; is say , one of the &quot; carrying of force &quot; .
Field more stable
Happens what same with the of Higgs , with the difference of that is of another field , the field of Higgs , that needs be &quot; &quot; for that hang .
Now well , the field of Higgs is great more stable that field . for ago lack to to energy extremely higher , a little as if like of a hole sobering in the so only a rock could scenario the surface .
Por this ago lack a in put of particles as the of the CERN ( ! the great of is a ring of 27 km of circumference ! ) for such achieve levels of energy .
The analogy with the field is a new tool that it the relationship between the Higgs and the mass .
Of fact , not all the particles not all the materials Royal with the field .
Some , as the eradicate , what do , but other not : a paper of role , example , not will never same politician to the door of a freezing .
And of the same way , not all the particles Royal with the field of Higgs : the what do have a mass , while that rest ( how the , true ) , not the have .
Now well , what &quot; can to &quot; all these research ? , question the madam Plamondon .
For the science , this it for verify the validity the model standard ( MS ) , and allows , also , that physical the differences between the comments and the predictions the MS .
Por their part , many want desire that are , therefore the will difference could open a door to a new physical &quot; &quot; that certain holes the model .
This , there that say , has still enormous shortcomings , as that not proposes explanation any on to the serious ( ! ! ) or to the on whites , that constitutes around the 80 % of the on the universe ( ! another ! ) .
But we not .ound such differences in the CERN to the time .
Impact
The impact of these research in our day to day are difficult of predict , but we not .hat we let the say that not will no .
For that Just : to at of the years 60 , the pioneers the infrared in the laboratories not in no the revolution that their jobs .
Entreveían the applications scientific , but nothing more .
Of fact , as already said the physical Willard Boyle , that worked in the laboratories Bell , where invented the infrared in 1960 , and that booklet the first infrared continuous ( the first were ) in 1962 , the principle the infrared was more well have a &quot; would of laboratory &quot; .
Imagine ...
And also , the applications can also to of whole the implementing that are to the research .
Por example , the same Willard Boyle booklet a of light in 1969 in the course of their research in on of angles .
To despite of that not was in no their original intention , this it now of &quot; eye &quot; for all the equipment digital the world , what that you thereby the Peace of physical in 2009 .
That not to say , course , that activities the LHC want necessarily into our lives , but that never know ...
Care palliative . the better way of die ... &#124; you Devoir
In their Commission die in dignity , Quebec Indian recently the sensitive question the end of the life .
The debate must joined soon while for a project of law .
Now well , within of that dominance essential , still there a that to .
You Devoir has tried it of close .
Ago hardly a weeks , the Sr. L. living only in their flat of the Montérégie .
The cancer of prostate that you was destroying you had given a breathing of two years .
&quot; I had given five years of life , but already have so seven &quot; , tracing , fact an is , in their bed in the centre of palliative care Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil , to the came the previous day .
&quot; but always is a shock , we not .e prepared for this &quot; , continues .
The disease you has caused havoc : a huge weakness that you from go only the one and even feed only .
At with to a lunch , on resigned that you help to feed .
Purposeful , an even to he , to about with the issue that you play attention , you bring medicines and you offered a .
The courage of the death ordinary .
&quot; my greater wish is that I the parasitic , is humiliating &quot; , admits .
A hours more later , the team found no to that .
&quot; in the course of our lives spend a man ago of ordinary &quot; , tracing pierre Brodeur , Guillermo in the centre Victor-Gadbois .
Return to their childhood , for certain people , is a unacceptable humiliation .
&quot; that on of the capacity of the person for accept that regression &quot; , complaints .
Because , according the opinion of the majority of the people that working in palliative care , the large at have place in the heart same of that regression .
All the patients that entering in the centre of palliative care Victor-Gadbois have cancer .
Have a prognosis of life maximum of three months .
In that state , the team of doctors and nurses that them around already not offered the care &quot; curative &quot; .
The greater fear of the Sra. A. , of 89 years , is die &quot; aware and &quot; .
But the disease you has fact be to their children .
&quot; have a good children &quot; , adds .
&quot; already not I are more wishes in this life &quot; , says , before of accept that you long a for overcoming to breathe .
And expected , in the next days , a last visit of their son that lives in Italy .
In Victor-Gadbois offers , with a group of voluntary , the care the body and aid to the food .
Are care palliative that them are when not can to nothing more .
For help to that their death be more .
In Quebec we with a bed of palliative care for every 11.700 inhabitants .
Is very little , already that we that all will die some day .
Here , the life continues in the best possible conditions , it the Dra. Christiane Martel , a of the male the centre .
Already be to level of physical comfort , emotional or spiritual .
The you offered of their with brandy or Pepsi , according the demand .
To the diabetics already not them controls their rate of sugar .
The death way part of what everyday .
Yesterday the night you uses a beer the Sr. X , that died in the course of the night .
This morning , their son end the beer to the feet the Patriarch .
&quot; about therefore to the patients as to their beings loved &quot; , tracing aged Savard , there of the care .
In the centre Victor-Gadbois the days discussions be never equal .
The on of a man of 94 years that their last meeting family in the yard , well was between their while all they to their health , a young of 36 years dies of way tragic , surrounded their parents , their woman and their two children , after have tried all for survive .
&quot; since ago six months , always there of three to five caged top people age of 45 years that of cancer &quot; , concerned the Dra. Christiane Martel .
A 53 % of the patients that are admitted in the centre Victor-Gadboisarrivent next of their home and a 47 % the hospital .
Problem the access to care palliative
A 77 % of the Canadians simply not has access to the care palliative , is say , to the care some for alleviate the suffering when an ill a to the terminal stage of their life , be in their home , in the hospital or in a centre of care .
And several bodies , as the centre Victor-Gadbois and the society of care palliative to home the Grand Montréal , almost exclusively in the care of the patients with cancer .
Is precisely that great we on in the care health of Quebec what that ago that many doctors Councils in palliative care fisherwoman the adoption of a law that noise the euthanasia and the suicide for .
Since the month of October , a clear signed of the care palliative , as the Dr. prejudice Mount and the Dr. Albert Lapointe , everything for demonstrate their opposition to such initiative .
According the Dra. Christiane Martel , the system health of Quebec is not what enough responsible as for ensure that who have right to care palliative of quality before of that accept to with the euthanasia .
&quot; recently &quot; , tracing , &quot; I seen to a patient to 14 days in topical large other suffering that has fact what necessary for relieve .
Fear that patients who die only because not receive the suitable care &quot; .
And parallel , many with their patients to the last day , to despite of the worst prospects .
The hopes of survival of Hélène Richard were already under minimum when he a treatment of chemotherapy exhausting .
&quot; when you I to my that wanted stop the treatment , she I said that you was very it that like to of fight &quot; , tracing .
&quot; Sin however , ! she I had said that not had nothing more that to ! &quot;
Not there care
The Dra. Martel believes a 90 % of the people that considerably die grateful to their carers that not them have with in their demands a time them has relieved their pain thank to a team of palliative care .
But there that say that palliative care not are absolutely in what that as the treatment the pain .
According Elsie Monereau , there of the care palliative to home of Grand Montréal , the patients not they to the treatments against the pain in a 8 % of the cases .
The end of the life , the doctors usually resort to the sedating palliative , that it for ball the patient to the time of their haemorrhaging , already be of way sporadically or of way permanent .
Not we pretend that we not .hat part the suffering .
Every time more , the disease not reassured is to have the possibility of have that sedating palliative .
The people that not are say all what same : &quot; I i die &quot; .
But that not to say necessarily &quot; i the euthanasia &quot; , but &quot; i that I &quot; .
The realisation of this exploit has been possible thank to a uniforms of journalism of the institutes of research of health of Canada .
Escándalos rented of great as in Quebec
Officials of the network road , employers the BTP , despised of funds of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia have , day after day , what that know of a frontier &quot; system &quot; , the are part the industry of the construction , officials , political , unionists and landing .
A &quot; industry &quot; that went too expensive to the taxpayers Quebec , on all in the years 1990 and 2000 .
&quot; is how the system a time we manager to the large media &quot; , Delors Duchesneau , Member in Quebec and former head of the police of Montreal .
He the outbreak the scandal in 2011 , that was possible thank to a research to Fund on the embezzlement compounded to contracts of roads in Quebec , that first Minister liberal of that time , Jean Charest , not had deceased more that in delay .
The &quot; report Duchesneau &quot; set a link direct between the industry , the illegal funding of the parties and the corruption between officials .
&quot; since the start of the research in 2010 , so only the Ministry of transport would saved billion million of dollars in contracts &quot; , analysing some of their prompts of stay with a proportional part .
The Commission Charbonneau &quot; already has fact we to two mayors &quot; , adds , while expected power to to &quot; demonstrate the ploys existing behind of the individuals &quot; .
A unit permanent corruption , created in 2011
The unit permanent corruption , created in 2011 , applies also with their team of controllers , researchers and analysts the government .
This unit works also of the police of &quot; the maps Marteau &quot; , since 2009 , have fact that &quot; cartel the undue &quot; of Montreal to the time of teach contracts .
These last weeks , the unit has allowed the registration in series of the accusations fraud and corruption against municipal charges as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte , Mayor of a city of the stopped .
The next of the list would Savary Vaillancourt , that has of resign of their since of Mayor of Laval , third city of Quebec .
Se suspicion that has bombing bribery to change of public contracts .
Se has accused formally to engineers of the network road of Montreal and to employers of Italian origin , as Tony Accurso and Wales Zambito .
This last has caused shock the explain to the Commission the mechanics the &quot; system &quot; of obtaining of public contracts .
He same paid for three years a 3 % the value of the contracts and in Montreal to a broker concerned to the mafia that money to dimension Montréal , the party the Mayor Gérald Tremblay .
M. Zambito money to are and are for the years 2000 , granting more of 88.000 dollars Canadians ( a 68.000 EUR ) to provincial parties , on all to the Liberals in the power .
Befriended , also , have organised a laptops of illegal funds for the ex-viceprimera Minister liberal , aged Normandeau .
The inflation the cost of the contracts of undue
In Montreal , the &quot; system &quot; of corruption did with effectively .
Savary Surprenant , of public works , what he perfectly to the Commission : in ten years received those , inviting to travel , of golf , restaurants , parties of Hockey and bribery of companies the sector of the construction a total of 736.000 dollars , all this to change of contracts of undue whose costs much .
Other officials of the network road have admitted that received money teach the bills between a 30 % and a 40 % in concept of counterfeit extra .
Also , a whoever the party the Mayor , Martin Dumont , it was to M. Tremblay of have fact the view blind deliberately to a budget parallel and country their coffers of money dirty .
To as of these revelations , M. Tremblay resigned to principles of November and was to Montreal to a huge crisis .
Chantal Rouleau was a of the first policies ourselves of Montreal that was sound the alarm .
As unable the district of Rivière-des-Prairies , in the of the island , opposed since 2010 to the sale of a ground municipal distinct 5 million of dollars and 1.6 million to the promoters in plenary boom estate .
The 70 % the money of the campaigns election was money dirty
Of the research that finally will to out , she will that remuneration &quot; of a balance for power understand the functioning the system , , for stop the and fishing to the guilty &quot; .
And adds that process is &quot; painful , but positive &quot; .
We their the injured but would lack a unit of research clean in Montreal and be very vigilant for that dubious practices not .
How to the tidying .
Regularly .
Delors Duchesneau , their part , states that &quot; the officials have stolen hundreds of million of dollars &quot; , but is on all the role of the &apos; political &quot; elected the aware of the thus &quot; .
Estimando in a 70 % the proportion of money dirty that on to the funding of campaigns election in Quebec , : &quot; I have said that is not more a for a of the reality &quot; .
The government proposes limit to 100 dollars the donations to parties , but that not will the donation , according he , &quot; while not speaking strictly the expenditure election , will money dirty in the policy &quot; .
Answers a full review the system of fair of public contracts and of funding of the parties : &quot; we not .e more under ; go the Fund of the things , with courage , we will rebuild the home with a foundation more solid , with more controls and laws &quot; .
If this history pleasure the international image of Quebec and of Montreal , M. Duchesneau attend to those that laughing to take the mirror .
&quot; ! the PSG is not the shout Barcelona ! &quot;
This season has distinct a new entity with the PSG .
How outbursts that progress ?
Se could explain a of individual awareness , but also the new dimension the PSG .
Have come large players .
Avanzo of day in day to their on .
The personal technical also I has has a .
And these elements I same to on to raise the level of my at .
In a party , that is more easy .
All is very quickly in the football .
But I not I .
Since my at in the centre of of INF Clairefontaine to my step Saint-Etienne , always I progress to steps bounds .
Is to obtain benefit of the competition Carlo Ancelotti .
The recruitment of this summer are used to also parties of very high level .
Know that every invariably is crucial .
That ago a player as I have wish of fight and take all .
other Por part , Carlo Ancelotti I provided a in as to my enabled .
Is supported deputy as claude Makelele , that in the same position that I .
Ancelotti is the man that needed the team ?
Por course .
Ancelotti have respect to all the technical .
Today today , not there nobody as in the League 1 and is between the best European .
Has a great experience and has cattle many titles with the best clubs .
Has worked with large players .
I that will other titles in Paris .
In January had a conversation very comforting with he .
I had of out of a series of injury .
The confidence that has in me it also my good performance .
What think on the PSG in the first part of the season ?
In the League 1 , Lyon we has taken the since of leader .
But we in the ambush .
One of our over objectives is the League of champions : we mainly for the of end with lifestyle .
What is the aim the club in this competition ?
We to try of to what more far possible .
To from of now , can to any thing .
But we a that say with to many and very good European equipment .
We , for start , end the first of our League with the Oporto for receive power the back of of end .
The PSG can become in a great European club to short term ?
Already has the budget ...
For become in a great European club , Paris has that earn titles and be there to long term .
Today today , that is not the case .
To economic level , the PSG is given to their media for that project never .
Not earn the World in the League 1 , as in the last season , would a great failure ?
Por course , would a great disappointment .
This year we to invest all our efforts in us that title of champions .
In the last season we not .ar .
In May we have a disappointment , already that had with the conditions privileged for I first .
Had a strong season .
Coal with 79 points .
Normally , with 79 points should have been champions ...
But another team , the Montpellier , had a season quite better .
This year i that will the good .
Even if the large equipment as the Marseille , the Lyon and the Bordeaux fighting the title , i that we with the weapons for .
Believes that media expect more the PSG ?
Is normal that be a of us if we in what that has made in the players that we .
What we accepted completely .
After of that 4-0 in home to Troyes , that still are with things that absence is a little frustrating .
We ask what more expected the people .
Never we earn 4-0 all the for of week .
! we not .he shout Barcelona !
We of to in a project of at .
A team build with time .
In the League of champions we shown that we to and be present .
! look the Manchester holder that , after two IFREMER , not has achieved into for of end , and them also have made great !
In view of the sums alas , you with 15 points of advantage to the working .
That would neglect to our adversaries and the championship of France .
Lyon and Marseille , that not were well the previous season , have seen &quot; powered &quot; this new PSG .
That shows that League 1 is prevent .
Hope that in May we say with a Around that , to despite of all the difficulties , we over the Leterme .
The PSG seems completely dependent of the successes of you you .
Better that say that we a &quot; Zlatandependencia &quot; .
That to say that you is very responsible and that many bottom goals .
Has come for demonstrate that is the star of the League 1 .
And has shown in all the equipment the has last that is a great player , a star World .
In the group we the man and the player .
And he also respects to the men that has to their around .
What that has fact is truly exceptional .
That to to the others to increase their level of at .
Thiago da , one of the best defenders the world , allows also that all move .
How Olivier through the football 2012 with the team of France ?
Has been a disappointment .
Was very himself participate in this football .
Unfortunately , my injury I was consecutively time of at .
I things there and I reinforced .
Today achievement playing good parties in the selection .
Is what that than since my baptism with the &quot; blues &quot; .
Learn the lesson of what that happened in Ukraine and to this must that today we a behaviour exemplary .
What vision you the first month of Didier Deschamps the with of the &quot; blues &quot; ?
Is obtaining results .
Are well located in the group of classification for the World .
The is stringent , have to the players and have to earn .
As was the case of Laurent disagree .
But not i to comparisons .
Disagree in their aim of for the football .
Hope that Didier Deschamps carried to the selection to Brazil .
The score ( 1-1 ) the 16 of October in Spain was for lay the foundation ?
That at we was confidence .
Every one all .
Before of that shock in Spain , not had through a at be in whole my career .
With Bitcoin , pay and sell banks
All what contrary to the monetary current exchanges , based in the central banks , the transactions hidden and the burdens of prosecution between the parties .
Also , as to often happens in the technologies , the vision policy is talking : the conviction of that system monetary current , up of monopolies banking , has to the financial crisis .
Of fact , Bitcoin , Zuse Satoshi Nakamoto ( a ) , is to the time a virtual currency converted to dollars , EUR , etc. and a Protocol of change sure to the way of BitTorrent , that allows the exchange of file of as to as .
Se have reported close of 200.000 transactions thank to 15.000 computers of the network .
And close of a billion websites website accepted the as donations or as way of payment .
The prices the , after have come to the top of 30 dollars ( 23 EUR ) in June of 2011 , fell to 2 dollars five months more later , before of again today to haunt the ten dollars ( the contributions in the indeed bitcoincharts.com ) .
Not is impressive nothing if what compared with the changes world in real currency or in financial products .
Sin however , the Bank Central European ( ECB ) was he in a report on the coins lot published in October .
In he , described the as &quot; the virtual currency with more success &quot; , &quot; that competing with the dollar or the euro &quot; and similar &quot; to the conventional coins &quot; .
Bitcoin difference of other systems with types of coins lot as the &quot; appropriations &quot; , used for move in an and that can earn playing or can buy ( and even in times ) .
The social network Facebook developed also this kind of system .
But in all exchange an authority Central controls and is the changes .
With the , all the nodes of network are to the time trustees of books of accounting , verifiers , interim of currency and buyers and sellers .
How works that network ?
Every compromise between two users ago in reality between two electronic directions in way of electronic email .
A user can choose a direction different for every payment , thus so the deeds .
A whole of information compounded to this compromise signing electronically to through of a system of have to double key .
The network can so verify the authenticity of the compromise .
Thank the content the file , is also possible ensure that changes of will in the book of public accounts , that you whole the network .
The milestone key is in write that new compromise in that book .
This is the resolution of a challenge have it to the computers and the winner , a kind of banker provisional Central , will the privileged of add that line supplementary .
Se is of a stage of of file , is say , of transformation of a great file in a left strength more short and only .
The computers &quot; you &quot; the new compromise and in a number before of &quot; &quot; the whole .
The aim is find the number that will a particular left ( more zeros the principle ) .
A time that is that number , the other nodes easily that is the good .
The compromise is then people to the chain of joint of the other transactions ; whole change replaced the left .
If , for commit a fraud , a user like pay two sometimes with the same money very quickly ( in least of ten minutes ) , the network only accept as valid a of the two transactions ; the other would , already that both have fingerprinting different .
The computer that opportunity the challenge has 50 .
For avoid the inflation , that to into in two regularly , with likelihood before the end of 2012 .
The number of in movement is , therefore , limited to 21 million , but are divisible to the , what that is a for broader .
The difficulty of this challenge reveals also in every increase of the power of calculation .
The life of the network has already their ups .
The websites website that offered services for Bitcoin have been attacked and have stolen in by .
&quot; the failure used not affects the same Protocol &quot; , will pierre Noizat , that has of launch Paymium , a company of payment in real currency that used the network Bitcoin .
The ECB has in account also the for of of money thank to this service fundamentally .
But the money in effective is the same fault .
The players of weight as one reject the payments of this kind .
Other , as the platform Wordpress , the accepted .
Recently , Adi Shamir and Dorit rum , the Insitito Weizmann in Israel , study the book of accounting and were that close the 80 % of not everything .
In November were the &quot; cheap giants &quot; .
&quot; Se changed 30.000 dollars &quot; , Jon Holmquist , that working for Coinabul , that becomes the in gold .
Pierre Noizat , author of a book locked on that currency , believes quite in the potential of this technology also of in the network of transactions .
Their system , Paytunia , is to a card of credit ( in real currency ) or to a payment mobile contact , but used Bitcoin for validate the transactions , that so are more cheap .
The her , also , variety their identity and can , therefore , remain in the deeds .
The system is easy of to in in the shops , that not have that on new intermodal not .
Them enough with supply a direction a telephone can &quot; and recognise &quot; , precise pierre Noizat , that will have thousands of users .
There a movement general of review of the systems aggressor systems more horizontal .
&quot; will lack a time for that Bitcoin will , but in 2013 could have a change &quot; , .
other Por part , in their report the ECB for enhance the various risks , today who higher , in case of that currency have success .
We out of Afghanistan .
And after ?
The French troops abandoned their area of responsibility in Afghanistan ( Kapisa and Surobi ) .
The NATO and the Americans must out to for of 2014 .
Is time of that army out truly possession of their territory and that Afghan choosing their future , wait nothing of us .
We punish on all to the farmers Afghan , to the we have terrorists .
And to us ourselves , with our 88 soldiers killed , more the injured and the maimed .
The Taliban have with extremist foreign and old Heads refugees in Pakistan , but to often also with farmers that reject the presence the army abroad , as in the times of the Soviet .
Want defend their traditions , old and , even if to their causes between the jihadist , the Pakistani , the Arab , the or the .
Tolerados , to sometimes even house the local insurgents , they already not what will when the Western do more discreet .
The starting of the French troops of the basis of Nijrab , that saw since what high of the tribes cultivation of thank to the French appropriations , was order .
The of lorry and of tanks were to Kabul have no attack , spotlight the helicopters .
Not will everywhere of Taliban in Kabul to from of end of 2014 .
The circumstances have changed since their progress between 1994 and 1996 .
Kabul was then we and the country dragged in ceasefire and blood to cause of the struggles between different factions .
Their the of control the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation , the return to the security .
The Afghan have paid the price the obscurantism of their farmers behind the organisation Al-Qaeda , but their situation is not better today .
The old , the current government and the current Taliban shared the wish of keep to the women in a position than .
The main personalities of the war only the power in 2001 .
Se have become in speculators , governing with areas government for as mirrors for the refugees that have again of Iran and Pakistan , benefit to the couple of enormous contracts Americans of cater .
Are ; the majority of them not have fought .
The people , according I heard in the field , is to a government that is not have honour .
Many young want leave , as also Iran the have known profit of the generosity American : the flight of capital is considerable .
The young are tired of the war and of their ideologies .
Have through the world modern for their in Iran or Pakistan and have in their advantages .
With around of a 65 % of their population will of 25 years , Kabul account now same with 5 million of inhabitants , a fifth part of the population total .
In the cities , the schools state are in therefore of girls as of children .
Will that to work to these young that not childless again the obscurantism of the old parties not to the corruption of certain leaders .
All , including the opposition armed , are or of mobile mobile . the television and their Turks that have a world modern has large admirers in all the country .
The army is now present .
Se assessment precise the authorities that want you the country ?
The old staff of the fight about already of They the provincial militias , that power Central .
Afghanistan , country of mountains , of strong local identities , should power benefit of a certain decentralization to image of the nations Western . Sin however , the States United what have wanted into in a state centralised , with a presidential strong power , removing the since the first Minister that there since the constitution of 1964 .
The President Karzai not to the control abroad , in particular with reason of the elections will in April of 2014 .
Not however , their country on of the foreign aid since the years 50 and even before .
No industry has their services , not has managed no not have repaired the systems of important irrigation .
All is imported and is not nothing are fruit and vegetables .
The priority is to the initiative private .
In a country ruined after 30 years of war , would been necessary the control government .
Se the rumour of that Afghanistan possessed enormous profit areas .
And that not was more that increase the sense of that Western were there for seizing of them .
Sin energy for from the mineral of iron or of as the ground and media of transport for export to through of the mountains , not there exploitation mining .
The Chinese already almost have abandoned the mines of as of month Aynak , being that prehistoric international ( financed the Bank World ) the in site and remain there as the employers more important of the province .
Will also lack that Afghanistan and Pakistan , country the on this imports and the exports , restored their normal relations .
The French troops left the 20 of November .
The new Treaty of cooperation for the continuation of the traditional aid : schools of girls , schools of children , a department of French in the University , the Institute French , the cooperation in the military areas , legal , health and agricultural and the support to the delegation resist .
Since 2009 , with the subject of try &quot; who the hearts and the haunting &quot; and of to the impossible task of to that aid and the actions offensive , a service of &quot; actions civilians and military &quot; the Ministry of defence ( Cimic ) , of in 2012 , brought and was bring to through of a small NGOs many French jobs of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in tens of villages of mountain .
These jobs , of obtain hand of labour local , have been help to contain the uprising : irrigation , wells , water drinking , reforestation , trees fruit , protection solar and increase of land of as .
What we as remember after two million of EUR of military expenditure ?
A budget more well modest will to the improvement of the conditions of local life , very tough in these gorgonzola located to often to more of 2.000 metres of all .
The Embassy received tens of demands written with small agricultural proposals made local communities of the province of Kapisa .
For that must of the uprising has to out the foreign groups , something that farmers I have said that want , would lack keep a small aid civil , well controlled and that them it directly .
A constitution with in Egypt
Is a new double or nothing the President Mohammed Morsi .
While that Egypt is more divided that never in as to the statement Constitutional , that you make provisionally powers a , he decided playing the all the all .
By to all the world surprise the Wednesday , when announced that House assembly would their text end the day next .
Ago so only a week , the head of state had given two months more to this House for end their jobs .
And ago almost two years that Egypt used a provisional text , several sometimes amended , what that it the institutional stability and has to judicial .
This new initiative not has fact more that increase the fractured in the country .
For their opponents , the ethical President in their &quot; grand &quot; and continues &quot; betraying their word &quot; and &quot; trampling the right &quot; .
Por part of their supporters , will that is of a measure for end more quickly with the institutional crisis and policy and speed the process of transition .
In the next 15 days should organised a referendum .
A time of time very short that forced to the Muslim to up to their project of explain the text , Article Article , to the Egyptians .
For the President , is also of a way of to a being popular and democratic while the discussion cause havoc in all the country .
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced of that Egyptians will to their favour , as said in an interview the respectable American time .
At that appeal has voted with very quickly , contains a for the Egyptian people : &quot; or vote my text or i the powers a &quot; , powers that supposed that to their end with the adoption of the constitution .
Is in that environment strange in the 85 Member of this House assembly , Islamist in their great majority , voted the text yesterday .
The majority of the Liberals not out to the call .
To in of November , a little before of the statement Constitutional , had closed the door because considered that not could to assert their points of view .
The representatives of the rights human , the religious minorities and of the society civil did what same .
To end of that was the necessary quorum , yesterday the morning But to 11 people , Member substitutes , to whole haste .
Some of them are very those to the Muslim Muslims .
As expected wait , the articles voted what have been unanimity .
To the commentators them ago grace , other part , the fact of a of the few discrepancies of the working has expressed virtually to the time of the sentence , therefore is so that several Member the Committee came to think that clock of the assembly was .
The text , that later yesterday was still being voted , certain of 234 articles .
The Article 2 , subject of all the expectations , still being finally same the of the constitution of 1971 , that stipulated that &quot; the principles of the Sharia are the source main the right &quot; .
The parties , for who the establishment of the law Islamic is a vindication fundamental , were that so replace &quot; the principles &quot; &quot; the rules &quot; , what that would allowed an implementation more strict .
For the Islamists , that Article not has been amended is a guarantee of their good will and of their respect towards the other components of the society Egyptian .
The Liberals what of hypocrisy and they that is not more that of an interpreted advertising .
According them , the Islam of the constitution ago to through of other articles .
Se are , in special , the Article 220 , that which to the University Al-Azhar a role advisory , in particular for all at that has of confirm their accordance with the laws of the Sharia .
According the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier , is disturbing because &quot; the people call to upon is not elected and not has no democratic legitimacy .
Here detect the premises of a theocracy &quot; .
The fears of the Liberals are also by the fact of that next rector of this University would quite least moderate that current .
&quot; Por now , not there an religious concrete involvement .
With this constitution we in the framework the state civil .
The majority of the lawyers that have working in that text not are intolerantly but it , some of them educated in the system French &quot; , it Alexis Blouet , that for an i on the transition Constitutional Egyptian .
But recognised that can have certain ambiguity in about the Article 220 , therefore the terms employees the vocabulary religious .
&quot; we talking in particular the term &#91; for Islamic , &#93; .
And the question that could be in the future would in what measure are the judges civilians competent for upon above of all this &quot; .
More beyond of their religious nature , the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that are to the powers prize that which the President of the Republic .
The Muslim Muslims that are few in compared with the were for the previous regime .
Another point contention : the powers conferred the army .
With the wish of the military , the review the budget of defence not will subject the Parliament , but to a national Council of defence .
Not will the from of civilians in military courts , as protestors the associations for the defence of the rights human .
These also were their concerns relating the text , that they was .
The crime of blasphemy in and , of now in forward , the insults are prohibited , what that could have serious consequences for the freedom of expression , on all the of the press .
Also , no Article emphasises the protection of the women , underlines Heba Morayef , of Rights Rights Watch .
According she , what only positive has been the ban of the torture of agreement with the Article 36 .
The word not one in the previous constitution .
Although the President Egyptian should out yesterday the night in the television , out demonstrations for this at .
The supporters the head of state demonstrated the Saturday .
In Israel , to the tourists Ukrainian them expect the land Holy , the However the world and a sea of from
The land promised being the ambivalent of the truths with the comfort modern and a nature .

In every one of them there swimming , substantial parks , and museums .

The sea died is still more warm and there by for all the year .
Por true , this sea , the more so in the world , is in the point more under the planet : to 417 values under the level the sea .
The waters blue of there are a from that easily maintain to to the not know swim .
The landscape of the but are truly dreadfully .

If travel to Israel , not worry if their English is a that desired : in this country around the 30 % of the population about Russian .
The money for this journey is not recommended taken in EUR , but in dollars , that can be easily to ( currently 1-3 $ , 8 ) .
The transport urban consists mainly the buses , but in Jerusalem there tram quickly and in Haifa is the only line of metre the country , that certain of six stations and it the low city with the city high .
In reality , is of a underground .
Travel in any kind of public transport costs 6 and this price can travel doing for 1.5 hours .
In Israel , according the tradition Jewish , the I is the Sabbat .

&quot; the large and powerful &quot; you will to Moscow : immigrants savers for the language
While Members and defenders of the rights human is on the consequences that bring the law on the examination compulsory , already have appeared in the country con that in with certified &quot; counterfeit &quot;
Every year , 13 million of workers immigrants they to Moscow , St Petersburg and other cities of Russia .
In their majority are citizens of countries of Asia Central : Uzbekistan , Tajikistan and Turkmenistan .
Their only aim is earn money for help to their families that have been in home .
Since the 1 of December will in force a law , according the which every immigrant labour must to an examination for check their knowledge of the language Russian .
Por now , this rule is applies only for those that have the intention of work in the sector of provision of services , institutions of services Community , domestic services and trade the will .
Sin however , with the time , as promise in the service Federal of immigration , the examinations will obligatory for all the immigrants .
Also , not will enough with holding the examination of the language , if not also the of Russian history and the of foundations of the legislation .
The knowledge of the language must confirm even for receive and renew the permit of work .
Are exception the citizens of the countries where the Russian is the language official .
Not will subject to this law the people that succeed obtain their certified of education and qualifications before of the dissolution of the Union Soviet in 1991 .
Usefulness , fatal and defence of the rights
The network of centres examiners will under the Institute of Russian language Pushkin , the University of the Friendship of the peoples , the University state of Moscow , the University state of St Petersburg and other institutions of education higher Russian .
The immigrants will stand to the evidence in all the cities , now same in Russia are open more of 160 centres of this kind .
The initiative on the introduction the examination was supported the Members of the Duma state and the service Federal of immigration .
But the defenders of the rights , a before of that law by in force , succeed many sometimes to this question to the press : and what will this in reality ?
What changes bring the mandatory the knowledge of the language , therefore for the Russians as for the own immigrants ?
In first place , they the representatives the service of immigration , this will reduce the number of people that suffer &quot; slavery labour &quot; .
Very people about today on the defence of the rights of the immigrants labour , it Emmanuele Sebelev , head of the representation the service Federal of immigration of Russia in Tajikistan .
The defence of their rights must shot before of their starting .
Only a system of selection organised will resolve the problem of the workers immigrants in a 90 % of the cases .
The problems the have the immigrants profession , education , the not know the language not spend the control doctor .
Sin the understanding of the language , says Sebelev , the future immigrant be condemned to find unscrupulous people that , with the pretext of help , you Please a &quot; paid &quot; to a caging and close , where he and dozens of other as he consume for months food not documents , working of 12 to 14 hours the day .
We an explanations of complaints of our immigrants .
&quot; in their homeland them promise a thing , but the to are unaware , them deprived of their passports , not them paid the wages Finns &quot; , confirms the head of the direction of immigration labour the service of immigration of Tajikistan , Tolib Sharipov .
! not , !
Sin however , while many therefore citizens of the republics of Asia Central that want work in Russia recognise that not only not know the language the country the to go , but that also in their language own write with difficulty .
Por course , this is not therefore their fault but their own unfortunately : are few the Uyghurs , , that they be the luxury of receive primary normal education .
This must to that their families even not have nothing that to of feed to the children , not about already of , and what necessary for the school .
The to to the adolescence , these boys safeguarded to work to the first opportunity .
Is difficult , if not know the language , recognise them .
&quot; one feel Ayr and than &quot; .
Sin however , in what that as to the law on the language , the defenders of the rights guarding a important point .
The examinations will to out only for those immigrants whose status be legal .
If not have that status , not will not examination and , in result , no work official .
While therefore , the majority of the workers immigrants are living in Russia illegally .
&quot; welcome or ban the step to strangers &quot;
Many visitors claim that receive the status official in our country is not so easy .
The cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language in .
Also , the legalisation costs money : of twelve billion to sixteen billion .
Sin however , a for false can to quickly and only billion over .
The employees of the police Russian know that generally have documents counterfeit , we not .ntered and officer the cases of extortion .
&quot; we they hundred or at for cigarette or teaspoons &quot; , a to the journalists the citizen of Tajikistan , Umed Hushkadamov .
&quot; we , not do , buying a paint &quot;
The first day of the entry in force of the law on the language , it of clear that not only the documents of registration of immigrants can be counterfeit .
Several certified &quot; counterfeit &quot; of knowledge of the language already have been fake officials the service Federal of immigration .
The documents counterfeit had been printed in standard of colour .
Por course , came to the hands of the new owners not as gift : every immigrant , facilitate the task of to the evidence , paid the document seven billion .
This is two sometimes and a more expensive that procedure official of examination , that cost the worker immigrant three billion .
The main task for a future next is protect the system against the corruption for that &quot; qualifications &quot; not they buy , the officials the government and the defenders of the rights .
To the time , the authorities can promised to the workers immigrants that not would been to with success the examination the first time more time for to the basic course of the language .
Also , to the immigrants that not speak Russian them grants jobs that not require active communication with the people .
The Ministry the internal not the measures down against the trade illegal of weapons
The percentage of crimes committed with weapons registered is quite small
The Ministry the internal proposes apply the law with greater rigid in relationship to the owners of weapons of use civil .
This is the reaction the government to the recent incidents : Apretar fired for festivities of weddings in the fortunately not there victims , and the massacre generated the lawyer disbanded Dimitri Vinográdov , in the Apretar seven people lost the life .
The police to ban the use and the possession of weapons inhuman in public places and raise the age minimum for the obtaining of licence for weapons , of 18 years to 21 years .
This idea was supported the summoned the Committee of the Duma in on of security and fight against the corruption , Irina Yarovaya , who promised that reforms in the law on the possession weapons will as to the Duma the state in a future next .
Not all feel pleased with the fact of that Russian authorities are trying of to this problem one the &quot; policy of hand hard &quot; .
In the network has appeared a open letter , whose authors , representatives of various social organisations of competitions , are that bear of such measures of &quot; sense &quot; .
The percentage of acts of tolerance with use of weapons registered is minimum , a service of news BBC of Russia , the lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov .
According statistics the Ministry the internal , for six months the year 2012 were 142 crimes with use of weapons of ceasefire registered in organs the internal , with the total of 1168 crimes registered for this same period .
The authors of the open letter are insurance of a legislation more strict in the sector of weapons of use civil not will a these for that criminal contribute the market black .
Now , according their words , in Moscow can find any weapon to under price .
While therefore , in the Ministry the internal says that situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control .
Suppliers : since factories to official
The market black of weapons relies to through of several channels .
The channels main are years , says the Colonel withdrawn Emmanuele Baranets , who for ten years worked in the Ministry of education and in the high state greater .
Caught of screen the website website that on orders of weapons
The first , &quot; foothold the faction or military &quot; , is say , the weapons that were flown for the military actions in the Caucasus .
&quot; the weapons were the official Russians and the ourselves &quot; , says Baranets .
The next kind of &quot; weapon black &quot; , the flown criminals and representatives of the forces of security .
Baranets it that here include the weapons of the stores of the police and those flown directly officials of the organs of get of the law .
The illegal weapons are to the sale since the military arsenals .
In many military arsenals to often had explosions .
&quot; there versions seeks of that some fires were damages for cover the lack &quot; , observing a .
According Baranets , the manufacturers of weapons also are their part of bit .
&quot; now have proliferating private factories of weapons that not are competitive in the international market and medication weapons under be the market black , including the of Moscow &quot; , says the expert .
A source more the market black is the smuggling .
Great amount of and and machine from of poor countries as Kyrgyzstan .
&quot; there have with their own production , to sometimes notions , and has have a mafia that has organised the flow of weapons &quot; , it the former military .
Of where come the weapons ?
The experts have calculated what is the participation shorter of every a of these sources of supply of illegal weapons the market black .
A report on this issue was produced in 2011 the centre of analysis of problems and planning of the management public .
The specialists study reports the Ministry the internal and of Rosstat , and data of public access of virtual whose implore this in about to the weapons .
The great majority of the illegal weapons , according the researchers , from of the forces armed and of the forces of security .
The half of the weapons the market black has come there &quot; fault of officials whose work is related with the weapons &quot; , says in the report .
According the researchers , the 17 % of the weapons from of places where there conflicts armed , the 14 % of the cases condemn for the production of weapons and the 5 % is to the archaeological illegal &quot; &quot; .
The dependent of a of the shops of weapons , that asked that their name not it mentioned , says that weapons we illegal not the buying nobody since ago already a time because are too this .
More to often , says , the suppliers encounter to military stores when need a starting .
To through of some , the supplier buying a unit , example a at TT .
The ones the registration and the spend above of the fence .
&quot; this has the weapon to the city and the sold to 900 EUR unit with two chargers &quot; , we account
&quot; but , clear , the police this therefore of all the Affairs , so that regular , when there that to the plan of discovery of crimes , out purchases of test to the their of illegal weapons &quot; , adds the dependent .
&quot; as in a of luxury &quot;
The must and the one usually is to through of known .
&quot; visited pages website and virtual to a kind that I proposed that outside to the platform &quot; Begovaya &quot; , where would a man that I would to a &quot; &quot; where we negotiate .
The price the weapon , I chairman only there &quot; .
military Comentarista Viktor Baranets
&quot; for to a weapon need a friend that have contacts &quot; , says the dependent of the shop . &quot; have a friend so , but not i a in he &quot; .
In the markets there sellers , but there also has that to , say &quot; of part the Sr. Ivanovih , that asked that you I that you had fallen a tooth to their daughter &quot; .
Even can to a couple of of steel to through of a person of confidence .
He also I the except only to me because know that not you i to .
The job for weapons of different ways .
The former military Viktor Baranets it to test in the role of one of illegal weapons to in of the years 1990 , when were to publish a Article on this issue .
The odd , according their words , not have changed .
You airliner a Georgian of photos where not had &quot; of all &quot; .
&quot; I felt as in a of luxury &quot; , reminds the military .
The one , according words of Baranets , not you offered a : all what that there can prove .
I , as client potential , not only country ; we with the must the forest , where our a white .
&quot; I are the opportunity of him and when I I of that weapon definitely well , we to negotiate &quot; , describes the procedure the expert .
Shop of televisions
The engines of for website nowhere to websites and groups of &quot; Vkontakte &quot; , where offers buy weapons &quot; for different your &quot; .
For this not required no document not personal events .
&quot; is enough have a certain amount of money &quot; , write in the explain advertising &quot; buy a at or a machine &quot; .
There the users do their orders and are questions .
And sold to age of age ?
&quot; Sin permit , course &quot; , question the user &quot; Iván &quot; ( those ) .

The service Federal of security has created a huge network of websites website fake and caught to two hands to those that want buy weapons of ceasefire .
And the people is , as eaten hungry towards the transported , and then , to from coal in Siberia
Military and Viktor Baranets
I heard about of these systems : what general , the website website is reported outside the reach of the laws Russian .
The people ago the orders .
The one for the payment to through of a cash cash .
&quot; in answer , you send a photograph and the instructions for that will where is hidden the weapon &quot; , tracing the Secretary of press of the NGOs &quot; the right to the weapons &quot; , at Kislov .
Viktor Baranets says that if ago an asked in line , one is weapon and what mouths in the prison .
The service Federal of security has created a huge network of websites website fake and caught to two hands to those that want buy weapons of ceasefire .
&quot; and the people is , as eaten hungry towards the transported , and then , to from coal in Siberia &quot; , says he .
Makarov 100 dollars
In the buying of weapons of illegal ceasefire , according the experts , one can spend of 100 to 900 dollars .
According at Kislov of the NGOs &quot; the right to the weapons &quot; , a at Makarov can acquire 100-300 dollars .
Se must wait a month and a .
Is sent since the military stores the Heads of they a .
Of agreement with the statistics official the Ministry , in compared with the period enero-octubre of 2011 , the number total of these crimes in Russia reduced in a 7 % , what that is 22.900 , and the number of cases at of theft and extortion of weapons , weapons , explosives and geographical explosives shrank in a 7.8 % .
Se are in strike the employees of restaurants of food fast and supermarkets in EE.UU.
To a quarter part of adolescents Americans are their first jobs as cash in &quot; McDonald &apos; at &quot;
In the last days , in the States United has on a wave of protests against the Netherlands wages that paid in the supermarkets of the ICANN Walmart and in restaurants of the popular chains of food fast , such as &quot; McDonald &apos; at &quot; , &quot; Burger King &quot; , &quot; Taco Bell &quot; , &quot; Wendy &apos; at &quot; and &quot; Kentucky Fried Chicken &quot; .
Por now nobody if to here if will or not this wave to the nine points , or if has aimed lose forces and in their first stages .
The actions of protest have with the support of the unions and of a series of NGOs of left .
Also the increase of the modest wages contemplate the workers of Walmart and the system of food fast , the aim of the organizers of the protests is the creation of unions of workers in these companies .
Por now , this sector of the economy virtually not has been occupied the movement trade .
Forty and six cents the year ?
The actions started the last week , after the day of action of thank , the called &quot; Friday black &quot; . that day , in States United the orgy of cheap that If to million of inhabitants , and that to sometimes was accompanied of clashes .
That day , some workers of the ICANN Walmart , that employs to 2.2 million of people in the world , abandoned their jobs of work and guards of protest with to the unions and activists of left in the shops of the ICANN , whose products encounter to people of income modest and moderates .
Walmart sold of all , since , revolvers of hunting and batteries for cars , to , eggs and milk .
The products in their shops are of average between a 8 % and a 27 % more cheaper that of the supermarkets more large .
Is that many workers paid of Walmart buy only in the work .
The availability and the had of products have fact of Walmart a of the corporations more large of America .
According the words two critical , Walmart can afford the luxury of sell products to very under price , in part because paid little to their workers .
These last also complain of the poor conditions labour , such as the lack of or naked of hand .
That &quot; Friday black &quot; the participants of the demonstration ruinous the increase of wages and complained of that cost the sure of health provided the ICANN happened of 30 to 100 dollars month .
For a typical worker of Walmart , a 9.5 dollars time , this expenditure is excessive , said .
Scientists of the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart is the wage a to 12 $ time , this you cost to the ICANN 3.2 billion of dollars .
This is approximately a 1.1 % more of what that spent in wages now .
If Walmart put the increase wage in the shoulders of the consumers , every visit to the shop them will only 46 cents more expensive .
In a year them will the ridiculous amount of 12.39 dollars more of what that on now .
The supporters of Walmart word satisfied that protest had place so only in nine States and that not was no loss to the ICANN .
The &quot; Friday black &quot; prolonged in their shops since the 8 of the later the Thursday to the midnight the day next and , for that time , Walmart miscalculations around of 5000 second articles .
In total , their boxes sterling held the &quot; Friday black &quot; almost 100 million of transactions .
The representative of the company , are Fogelman , declared in an interview the website website of left Huffington ex , that was their since of work &quot; least of five &quot; employees of Walmart and that protest not had been more that &quot; another trick of public relations &quot; , organised the seconded of workers .
&quot; ! free box ! &quot;
The protests continued this week in new York , in the objectives not were precisely the large stores Walmart ( that in this progressive city not them have hold , and that now not there none ) , but the &quot; McDonald &apos; at &quot; and other restaurants cheaper .
! McDonald &apos; at says that sold thousands of million of pieces , and then not even you Volvo the low disease and not you paid your work honest !
Jumaane williams , Member the municipal Council of new York
Currently , of agreement with the law Federal and the of new York , the wage minimum is of 7.25 $ time .
The restaurants of food fast what will increasing with the time , but only slightly , and of average , the ordinary receive workers in new York 8.90 dollars time .
Nobody earns least that them in this city .
How is possible survive in new York with that money , for me is incomprehensible something .
There a time when almost the quarter part of the adolescents Americans experience the McDonald &apos; at and worked there , behind of the desks , to time over after of the school , although still living with their parents .
Few were the his this as the main source of income or stay there a time .
Now , constantly in some interviews with workers of McDonald &apos; at that complain of that have that live of this wage , and to sometimes even which to their children .
Por another on , in a forum of the magazine Wall the Street there a comment whose author out that is irresponsible have children if not know with what them of feed .
The participants in the protests , that started to the 6 : 30 of the morning the Thursday in the McDonald &apos; at of the 40th the and Madison Avenue , ruinous that to the cash and broth of food fast them start to pay what least 15 $ time , or be , that them double their wage current minimum .
Also ruinous that in the sector of the food fast believe unions of workers .
The law of the EE.UU. prohibits to the administration restrict this right and punish to the activists the movement trade with tricks and redundancies .
other Por part , rarely time the administration them facilitates the life .
But , reasons objective , is easy that unions the sector of food .
A of the main is the excessive rotating the personal .
Discordantes
Ruidosas protests had place that same day in other restaurants cheaper of Manhattan .
The culmination of the action had place to half the rally in the McDonald &apos; at it close of Times Square , in the several political took local democrats , in particular the Member the municipal Council of the city Jumaane williams , that said : &quot; McDonald &apos; at says that is sold thousands of million of pieces , and then not even you a hospital not you paid your work honest &quot; .
The demonstrators received the support of other leading democrats of new York , example the candidate to Mayor of the city garage of Blasio , that said that &quot; we support to the workers the sector of food fast for that forgetting receive fair wages and the economic prosperity that deserves every &quot; .
As what described the newspaper chosen York Times , this has been the greater demonstration of this kind in the history American of the food fast .
But in she took only a few hundreds of people , even not all them were employees the service of food fast , in the tens of thousands of people of new York .
Still is not clear if this will of lit for to a movement mass .
&quot; Por now , is the which is not so easy &quot;
The issue of the reality increase , so popular between the sports to the technologies modern , recently is with as mainly to through the prism of special glasses .
To beginning the summer , in their annual conference Google proved a model in movement and subsequently , in November , it that Microsoft had tabled also a request for ombudsman the attached patent .
Sin however , of a conversation with the head the group of interactive technology 3D in the laboratory of Microsoft of Cambridge , Izadi Sharamom , that for the scientists of this company , the glasses already been to a last stage .
To them them attracts the perspective of the manipulation of items lot in the air with the hands naked and the creation of areas open lot .
- Por favour , in general terms , what is the subject of study of their group of research ?
- we to the interaction persona-ordenador , but also we of further the limits of this interaction .
Por now the humanity in their great mass has been trapped in the stage of work with the of the flat screen , to sometimes the it with the finger .
But us we look 5-10 years forward and speakers the changes winds in this interaction .
Por example , the video Xbox and the sensors Kinect represent a step forward and today in day no Xbox sold Kinect , already that to all them interested the control gestures .
- what more we be the future ?
- to despite of that Kinect has taken the interaction the physical level , great part of this still happens in a flat screen , to sometimes in 3D .
The introduction of information has just ( the system a more data ) , and the exit still is not very good .
We trying of change this , we in systems of nigh truly , based in different technologies , including the of design .
Se must release the world of the is the our , the physical , do more tangible .
For this , however , is necessary recognise not only the user , but also the space that what are .
Then we complete the world real with items lot of a way more comfortable .
In first place , ! the pan with these thinks helmets of virtual reality !
- what think you on the control voice ?
A detail very popular , but not believes that what ?
- clear that not you can be a panacea , is outstanding of resolve the question of privacy , already that not always to that others through of our actions and intentions .
Of fact , all the types of interaction with colleges are good , but every one in their own field .
Por example , for the control of equipment in public places , we a project in the we in the gestures , but not in movements loose , but more short .
Also , the gestures were every not the House the has , but an is that risen the movement of the bones and the muscle .
Por now is very large , but in theory can be small the size of a clock of is .
But , in general , the future is for a kind combined of control , example of gesture R voice .
- how is that ?
- Por example , how I would you that you ask this ha of ?
You shall and the bring the same time .
- normally I only i .
- oh , that is to be very difficult of recognise .
- or be , you to force to the users to adapt to what that can or not can to in this time the machine ?
- not necessarily , but is a mutual rapprochement .
I that in a future next we to have that work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that they determine with precision the reactions of the person .
These can be , example , sensors infrared , already that provide a good resolution in depth , what that is very important .
- if we of their work with the sensors of Xbox Kinect , what complaints has you of the chambers modern ?
Them lack resolution , depth or something more ?
- in principle , the current generation is what that can be the start of our work with the recognition .
Por course , would good obtain 8 to the at of 1000 .
But the question is not in the , but in the quality of the parent and in the depth .
Since this last point of view , all the current technologies not are what enough good for us ; this more work to the designers of .
Or be , that we that remember not only the resolution in the central X and and , but also in Z.
Also is important the at , the number of second tables .
The human movements are quite dynamic and the current of 30 are truly scarce , on all for the gestures .
Steven Bathiche , of our laboratory in Redmond , was a rises of contact with of prosecution of 1 to 100 and is mention that modern sensors produced in series are more close the second value ( 60-100 ) .
Not all the world understand in what measure this affects to the interaction hombre-máquina .
To me I would very useful for my work an equivalent of such has , but that not take contact for that tables second are more .
- and is not necessary increase the number of chambers ?
- the Kinect has now three &quot; chambers &quot; , a of the which is of fact the of rays infrared and the second the recipient of the signal has .
But the third House is in reality a simple rises the visible .
This not used for determine the depth the subject .
Potentially , more amount of chambers could resolve the problem ...
Or the contrary , increased and fundamental the amount required of are .
Would good create a flexible prove of Kinect , playing with the curvature of location of the chambers and see how this help to the position .
- Por what that I remember , Microsoft , to difference of Google , not has tabled their glasses the public .
Not you seems that , since the point of view the use on of technologies of reality increase , the glasses are a of the platforms more we ?
- Por course , to all the pink quo in high a telephone intelligent in the hands , is not very comfortable , but I think : the better option would a reality increase &quot; &quot; when , in basis of a platform of cloud , you could to of the glasses the telephone intelligent ,
The glasses are equipment very personal , in that is their force ( the private things only you will see ) , but also their weakness : a reality increase based in glasses not you will work on items lot with with other people .
- imagine a time that manipulation of items lot in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film &quot; Iron Man &quot; , but also for any simple deadly .
There a problem in this idea that critical usually out : ! not there answer !
! the hands not feel nothing !
What answers for their group for this challenge ?
- in my conferences to often say that reality increase is the seventh just in the interaction between the man and the machine .
I that eighth well could be the addition of sensations .
While therefore , one of the noticed more interesting is the use of the second hand in quality of aid for the image .
! with the you perfectly !
But there also technologies that are truly win to to to these &quot; images in the air &quot; . Por example , the interference of several rays targeted to a specific point where is the finger a that similar to the one feel if someone as in the of the it , but that still is very weak .
There also for the jailer that on in the of the it , this also a direction promising .
- has Treaty of is the which ?
To think that he feel what that seems that should feel in the time in that is something ?
- that is a good idea , still not what we tried .
Here behind another challenge with the we that fight for a time , how to a person physically within in a space very small creates that is to a open space , almost end . we working also in the idea of the we of to ( not as the of the gyms ) , platforms mobile , so as the of the much giants .
Por now , is the which is not so easy , still there that work for many years .
That is what that ago attractive the work with the virtual reality for the researchers , that many things are in a state of total view .
personal Will focuses in place of culture - Rosbalt.ru
&quot; Rosbalt &quot; continues the project &quot; Vanguardismo of St Petersburg &quot; , into to the citizens that are front , to the forefront the art and of the culture .
In this list of the best are it figures the art and the scene of St Petersburg , whose achievements they more beyond of the city : to often are recognition in Europe that Russia the man even .
The new hero of &quot; Rosbalt &quot; is the artist Kirill Miller .
Whole the city known to Kirill Miller , a man clothing of red of down from , the can find close the Museum Russian , close the garden of summer or in meetings of fashionable and .
The tables of Kirill Miller always by to , where wants that desks .
Kirill Miller is one of these purely of St Petersburg , are of new .
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative the of St Petersburg of end of the 80 - principles of the 90 .
Also , is a man urban , whose emergence in the streets of the city meeting in the inhabitants grins and comments to all the state of mind .
Recently , took in their hands an and became in the of St Petersburg , already that has grown for to so difficult role , their existence Bohemia , their philosophy and their image .
- Kirill , what you the city clothing of red and not of yellow or , example ?
- Elegí the colour red because am leather of fashionable and I am to the about and to the image .
In this world , the colour red is a compromise between the artist , the are of images and the society .
Although in the society , all what that not be a little grey for aggressiveness and extremely of properties good nothing .
But my simplified are in to that significant a conversation .
Whole the history of my actions are an invitation the debate .
- when that be artist ?
- in a statement the Palacio of culture Nevsky , where paraded my jobs .
I realised account of that was my way .
Then the wave of old artists not official had over , and the new , free as I , were still .
I i friend of artists of the new wave , with the subsequent to the from in Gaza and Nevskiy , that was to &quot; Pushkinskaya-10 &quot; , and already over the new wave .
I in the theatre the clothes , the music of all the up , but not the you .
- and all this in your clinic of art ... - for me was important certainly in the cultural centre of St Petersburg , where be together the best minds creative .
In 1995 , previously a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there , while not had reforms , broad a artistic musical club , a club resort , the home of the Bohemia of St Petersburg .
Many born there : Noms , Tequila about , remember the way in that Schnur brought the project to &quot; the eartag of will bold &quot; .
Schnur and their friends small songs under , trousers meagre , between them was the currently composer of fashionable Angelika Vdovin .
When the group started to play in live , became in &quot; Leningrado &quot; .
Trachtenberg was of many programmes before of the times of Hali-galivskih .
Them we to Trachtenberg and was the start of their great career ; the basic education and training the received of us .
Gallery &quot; D 137 &quot; , the &quot; club Griboyedov , are the remains of the clinic the art .
There would our employees and customers travelled .
Am a hero the last century , when the culture mean something .
In the year 2000 , the survey was in the press , the Prize was &quot; the people of our city &quot; .
In the nomination &quot; artist the year &quot; i elected I , so end my culmination .
In these new times is not comfortable work ; I am a man the you like the truth , the honesty and the culture the last century .
In our times is easy popular done , but the culture and the popularity will separate . one can be popular but very little seems .
- there in your jobs recognisable something .
- many of my paints are , in them this clearly the today and the commonplace .
I to to a statement agenda , &quot; the Museum Russian in buffoons &quot; .
The buffoons are a category timeless .
I before was her , but now be so is painful and other .
But in the buffoons all and the tragedy would .
I love what grotesque , have ideas grotesque .
Por example , the saved the world by a change totalitarian and compulsory of clothes .
Now to one what are the clothes , in what external , but not in the internal of the person .
And , such time to that person not you should not to the hand , but in the face .
And the deception will when changes of clothes .
- ago little you we in the role of urban . - a city must have a hero so .
! who better that I for become !
- well but , to what better the art trade can be broth ?
- now the art trade must be careful , fresh , have you .
We being witnessing of the disintegration of the cultures .
Before the people in some , the wanted a thing , the other .
Now all have divided in , is difficult please to all .
Not am a ticket of hundred dollars for like to all .
Now there that think to who your favoured .
Now , every hero of seems has their 100 fan .
- ! and for listen to Stas Mikhailov they thousands !
- will to it the neglected , there works the sexo-social sphere .
And to an cultural event will 300 people , 10 billion never come . as result , least management , least money , all .
Have to my fan , what more important is not deceive , not to to lose what that Olivier achieved .
When was young was such tables a your in the wall the on of Falk and Larionov .
I I with paints , with the what general the people stops .
Now to often who the concepts .
Say spiritual culture , culture of consumption .
Not there no culture in the consumption , that is other history .
I am a man of the culture of yesterday , under the example of artists that living in the poverty and died in the poverty , obstruct the money only for paint tables .
I am to favour of this culture .
- Kirill , what is what that you lack to St Petersburg ?
- good experts in culture .
There a concept : official of the culture .
But not all them can their to the culture .
When the on were the right all was of other way , the on such time not seaports very well the culture , but they that was necessary keep to the experts right .
In Moscow now there very good consultants .
We people in St Petersburg that well could be experts , but are closed , because need experts to a level higher that nevertheless that to they and them open way .
Now is the will personal focuses .
What same Erarta , but the difference is that them say honestly that not all the art modern is accepted , there some artists that have that to other museums .
- what is for you St Petersburg ?
- St Petersburg is not a cultural capital . in Moscow there very more culture , there there ground .
But on our stones is difficult that art grow .
Need ground cultural and we now more writers that readers , this is .
In Europe there a lot of people with curious that is to exhibitions and concerts .
In our case , this class is tiny .
We that to that art is of fashionable , as what was to at the last century .
The project nabucco with a subsidy of St Petersburg .
To to light in the space
The land is in danger .
Warming global or clash with an asteroid murderer .
Poorly of vessels space with human to board proceed in for of a planet of spare .
For keep the humanity ago the question main : how continue the kind in conditions of cannot or in the same planet of spare ?
I that there little where choose .
Of fact , only two are real planets that can be colonial , the least .
&quot; these are Venus and Mars &quot; , says the scientists head the astronomic Institute state , Sternberg P.K. ( IAES ) , Vladimir Surdin .
But if the conditions in Mars are best for the life , in the surface of Venus the temperature is of 500 degrees .
Only can live to large or in the about of Venus ... in the space .
Se started to address the problems of reproduction in the space with the flora .
Ago already a century that were to out experiments with plants .
Four generations of peas in about not differed in nothing of the varieties outlaw .
After wine the rearing of insects in the about , small crack of the fruit , the .
In 1979 submitted the space eggs of for check how develops the embryo in conditions of cannot .
Helps as result a normal .
But then start the problems .
&quot; the problem is in that has that find support , must in on their own feet and start to ! &quot; , it Vladimir Sychev , the director the laboratory the Institute of problems Biomédicos ( IPBM ) of the Academy of sciences of Russia .
The not find support , the by the gambling .
And after of 10 hours in the would babies was a total of the prompts .
The not ECU to the light not the Audio .
And the unfortunately was that out of four days simply died .
&quot; and two sometimes we that born the , but then what stop because was impossible work there with them &quot; , , observing Vladimir Sychev on failure the experiment with the in the space .
The last time a &quot; biological &quot; did to the about was ago 16 years .
In the spring the 2013 foreseeable the experiments .
Sin however , in the &quot; Bion &quot; only travel species of a same sex .
There an experiment with EFSA , that were settlement the space already with foetuses .
In principle , not found nothing .
&quot; this was precisely in the , but this was an experiment only , and studies as this must be to out &quot; , observing Vladimir Sychev .
After the landing , the EFSA space had offspring .
Sin however , still not has managed address the problem of the reproduction directly in the space .
Is a challenge difficult .
The animals , the lose their habitat her , simply not can to their your sexual .
The man , however , to difference of the small animals , in principle , can .
The Homo has the reasoning abstract and is capable of create a emotional Fund appropriate .
similar Experiments not have to out ethical reasons .
But the women travel the space since ago already 50 years .
The greater risk what happened Tereshkova .
And what more precious that has the humanity is the Agency female .
Our flying , and nobody in the land could say : if is after of a flight the space .
Will or not have a baby after of this flight .
&quot; after of all , to this question nobody has would &quot; , observing the contractor the sector aerospace Vakhtang Vachnadze .
In June of 1964 , only after of a year the flight the space , the first woman , Valentina Tereshkova , it was to light to a daughter .
The father of the girl , Andrian Nikolayev , was also .
In 1988 , the second woman , Svetlana Savitskaya , who two sometimes was in about and even worked in the open space , had a son .
Sin however , the risk there .
We few , are wall the astronauts to who after of long flights all them has result well , and a healthy next generation growing .
&quot; and if can say more , is dangerous even in flights &quot; , sums the pilot , hero of the Union Soviet , hero of Russia , Valery Polyakov .
Sin however , the humanity must to some new to in the biotechnology , in the protection radiation , in the creation of the serious artificial .
The centre of preparation of is a stage compulsory in the preparation for the flight .
In conditions of would , the profess their skills of work in the space .
The water the cannot .
If for an adult the water is an comfortable environment , although still hostile , for a child would born is their element home .
The small hombres-anfibio seem confirm that life in the land about the Ocean .
There a connection between the fact of that baby even approximately 9 months within of their mother in the tanks , therefore you will more easy used then the water .
In principle , this is logical , because since the time the birth to the time the first one spend only 2 weeks .
&quot; this is very little for forget something &quot; , says Marina Aksenova , of swimming of would babies .
In short , if the cannot is a state more natural for a would born , for the women is necessary the force of the serious .
In the cannot the muscle and of the very quickly , the capacity of expulsion the experiments reduces .
Good , by in the action of encouraging for the childbirth .
Se can , course , to to light in a special House , this what .
&quot; and then what ? &quot; , Valeri Polyakov ago this original question .
other Por part , the child also needs serious artificial .
Sin the of serious , the Agency not generated the skeleton not the system lymphoid .
To a would born in about is impossible with a special suit for , as to the adults .
Simply you time of what that is vital for he .
&quot; and this experiment that we to to together , the allow the birth of a child in an environment strange , will place to that to the land to a disabled , to a person completely suit &quot; , for the head the Committee of bioethics the Institute of problems of the Academy of sciences of Russia , Angelika Pestov .
Por now , the birth of children in the space is a theoretical question .
Sin however , with the time this will a reality , when the human beings in their vessels Conventions to a planet ago that will the home for their children babies in the space .
Head of NKÚ : the inspection the system &quot; &quot; not has given with the political guilty
In on of public tenders , the Republic Czech account with good inspectors and a legislation of quality , although their implementation .
So what says Ransdorf Kala , of of the office of control by ( NKÚ ) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
&quot; the law never will perfect &quot; , but their implementation must be right . &quot; this is , in my opinion , what that we lack &quot; , so describes the current situation .
The controls joint of the inspectors Czech and Germans also they to similar conclusions .
As example of a practice wrong , mentions the attitude of Petr Nečas towards the system of be be only on the role , that known as the system &quot; &quot; .
The first Minister said recently that ODS ( democratic civic party ) not to the employers with inspectors . then , is ban or allowed ?
&quot; the law must be suppressed of some way and if prohibits something , in that case , not the President the government can prevent the action of the office that has the duty of to these controls not demand obligations &quot; , complaints Kala .
In the meeting of the Commission of control in the Congress of the Members , Ud. spoke the common project between the team Czech and the German , in the framework the which Karadzic the legislation which to the public tenders in both countries .
What is exactly ?
Se is of a control parallel that are to to ago a two years .
Said of way simplified : the European legislation how must organise the public tenders , to this you still the legislation existing in every country and , after , the these in .
Us what we UK all and , although the control still not has complete , we successful differences very interesting . generally , the legislation of our country is &quot; more strict and more full &quot; , however , the these concrete in some parameters is better in Germany .
Se confirms , therefore , that not enough with integrate rules every time more stricter , but that is necessary focus in the implementation of the law same .
What can to of fact this project ? what believes that are the conclusions ?
Precisely a common control of this kind could make to that Age of invest efforts in the of the laws , the reduction and the improvement of the limits , although this not have an impact so positive .
The economy the savings means to a thing appropriate to a reasonable price ( what that not always means that price be the more under ) for avoid so the enrichment and , to the long , the criminal actions .
But not the fact of reduce the limit of the tenders to say that we to this .
Perhaps because the system is saturation with therefore &quot; tape &quot; , that those that want to failures in the system will do more easily that if the limits maintained so higher as now .
Ud. about of the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the of the public tenders .
How works the system of controls in Germany ?
Is an office analogous to our NKÚ or t of other way ?
In how to the offices , as the NKÚ , there it the Bundesrechnungshof ( Court Federal of accounts ) , with an organisation similar to the our , with a school also , what only is that in their case is structured of a way a therefore different , but in principle both offices evolve parallel .
Also the powers are to true point , however , in therefore that Germany has an organisation Federal , the courts of accounts are even to this level . in this aspect from slightly of our system .
The Court Federal of accounts ( BRH ) only can control the money Federal , what that here call funds state .
The public funds , that are administered the regions and the municipalities , there , in Germany , monitored in the Court Federal of accounts .
In as to the local legislation , is more simple that our ?
Por what general , not I like establish a compared specific data . not however , Germany still being a model in some aspects , but not can must with what in what is better .
Could be better , example , in as to the quality of the inspectors ?
That sure that not , but , repeat , not I like to this kind of comparisons .
Is necessary say that even those countries that we as model must to with to a great number of problems .
If not outside so , not them contribute no benefit cooperate with our office , not believes ?
In as to the legislation of our country , what meant for their office the amendment of law on the public tenders ? Se to of some way their impact ?
Taking in account that period of validity of this amendment is relatively short , still not has said in the actions of control .
Given that time former controls ex , is be have with a true delay .
Por now , is in the process of preparation of the controls future : we on a new tool of &quot; detection of risks not economic &quot; , the we fact to almost 14.000 public tenders , that have been considered . the changes will perfectly about here , already that modify the limits , the conditions of some types the process of selection and similar .
As that adoption of this law is beneficial or that , more well , is a patchwork for the bureaucratic system ?
I that law is surely a step in the direction right and hope that so be .
The problem that can eventually is that regulation &quot; strengthened &quot; and that be impossible must .
Already with the previous regulation , the people controlled were linked the contractor ( example , in the case of the operational regional programmes the regional Council ) , and every law not respected in on of public mean tenders the violation of the discipline budgetary .
Has sense then tighten the law of this way ?
I that not of this way .
The system must from to those that want or profit of he and not punish to those that commit a formal failure , that not has impact in the of decisions .
A system of this kind only will create a greater bureaucratic pressure .
And how its of this ?
Will towards where we has this way on .
The first Minister has declared recently that ODS not to the employers with controls the called system , with reference the fact of be be only on the role . what means this ?
The system &quot; is ban or allowed ?
The law must be suppressed of some way and , if prohibits something , then not even the first Minister the government can prevent the action of the office that has the duty of to these controls and demand obligations .
Can say : &quot; Cambiamos the law and what allowing &quot; , but not can say that we as if nothing .
In the law on the public tenders , the regulation is quite strict in as the way in that must act formally . and so is as must be for protect the competition public .
But , another on , is tragic that be the candidate with the better supply not to the formal demands .
The law never will perfect , but their implementation must be right . this is , in my opinion , what that we lack .
The roads have Rachinel of ice , although in their majority are passable
In several places of the Republic Czech the roads have Rachinel of ice and of snow .
Although the majority of the to are passable , in some must likewise the caution .

Ornest : in our concerts we consecutively positive energy
Se says that in little least of a month is to to the end the world , what view on this ?
Only is a of between many other news alarmist to the we like ultimately .
The group of music the Tap Tap we like more well to jokes on this and we like say that we the only group of music the world that manages together enough positive energy for postpone the end the world or for prevent .
Also , in December a project really original : three concerts against the end the world .
Can explain to our readers ?
Se is of an beneficial act state that have organise since ago two years .
We we to take the potential of marketing that has the end the timetable wisely for the 21 of December to the 11 : 10 of the morning .
The previous day , the 20 of December to the 21 hours , international 3 concerts we in Prague , Brno and Ostrava .
Standardise approximately to the same time in the stops the timetable in the island Kiribati , in the Ocean Pacific , 12 front hours of our explainable area .
To who you happened this idea ?
At was idea my , after were the project all together with our leather Honza Augusta .
Also of to together enough positive energy and avoid the end the world , also we think , with with the society , on the state in that we the world to our children .
With occasion the end the timetable also we created a now only of articles : you , parcel , combined and original against the end the world that can year in www.e-tap.cz , other way of safely .
The group the Tap Tap , with with other interpreters , also sung the called anthem against the end the world , that has title &quot; end the world , cancelled &quot; .
Currently is very popular in YouTube , will hear in the concerts Live ?
Clear that , and will fair the last , good , always that all it well and not a world ...
The all the interpreters the same time in the three concerts .
The between vet thank to the special broadcasting in direct in the television Czech .
Tomáš Hanák has writing the lyrics of this song and belonging the role leading of Jesus in the , where also singing Xindl X ...
How about this collaboration ?
We together even with other personalities of the cultural scene Czech , from of many organise acts Live and concerts ...
Our all our as in participate in this project .
Se has shown that to the majority of them them interested and them work with us .
To what will the money youngsters in the concerts against the end the world ?
To equipment for the centre education barriers Studeo , that have to term in their sixth year running with the partnership civil Tap in Jedličkův .
The of the school of Jedličkův receive regularly the visit of teachers with the out activities humorous and interesting .
The not have of economic media enough for pay to the teachers and we a for possible do .
In the framework of the completion of the works in Jedličkův , will a building independent the we with this project .
In every of several act groups and interpreters .
What are the criteria of selection ?
So up a programme that be attractive for all the generations , including the children .
Por example , in Prague Chinaski , Support Lesbiens , Illustratosphere with are Bárta , the Tap Tap , Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý .
For obtain information more detailed , Now put www.kpks.cz.
You measures any other &quot; action witnessed &quot; similar in the future ?
In May we first time in the festival Pražské , so that here surely preparing a programme attractive with invited interesting .
The year that next also we like play in the Bohemian National Hall of new York and to me , personally , as that we in States United , I like amplify with actions in Washington and in Chicago .
Vuestros plans in the abroad not are precisely , to now you action example in Madrid , Brussels , London or Moscow .
The Tap Tap is , not however , a group have people with disabilities .
How is the logistical and the organisation of these travel ?
Not is so difficult how can appear to first view .
There five Member in wheelchair of wheelchair we , the chairs must travel in the stationary for luggage and also have a weight , the boxes with the instruments ...
Sin however , to now we the we managed well . and British major were perfectly prepared , thing that is not of puzzles .
Even in Moscow , of where we their ago little , went all problems .
Thank to the through the abroad Now for the different attitudes of the society towards the disabled and other aspects .
With what you you found to now ?
In Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other cities , all works better that here ; in Russia we been witnessing of that , in the , is a way go .
To difference of Prague , Moscow is full of barriers , there still be often a person properly single the centre of the city in a wheelchair of wheelchair we .
Something so aware as is , example , to preference to someone in wheelchair of wheelchair in lift , there not what is .
Por fortunately , has created a partnership civil that intensive the problems of the people with disabilities .
In what aspects we take example of countries more progressive ?
There many aspects in the we behind ...
But is important mention that as and the improvement of the situation always on of the people to the affects directly .
In London and in Madrid is very normal that people with a serious disabilities properly their account in public and can go the service , the Museum , where wants ...
But is not very common a great number of people with disabilities obtain in the social life of active way , in this aspect , with the Tap Tap ! we a little front !
A society pursue or barriers is a thing , but when it the time in the establishment eminent athletes , artists , players , political or lawyers , start to change all of truth .
To now , are cases isolated of people that have a great force of will .
The group the Tap Tap is currently very popular , but if at a years back , what you was to be the group in 1998 ?
I as in Jedličkův , where had very people young to my around that wanted their to something .
And since that I am musician , , between other , a group healthier with an about of work .
And with the time , as says our mediating Láďa Angelovič , we was a little of the hands ( laughter ) .
Sin however , the popularity not came to these last years , or I wrong ?
Is truth that we helped quite the fact of connecting with famous singers and also work actively for promote the group .
We to the conclusion of that work that is not , is as if not existed .
Thank to the aid of the Union European , we to also teachers of quality , equipment , etc.
Belong intention of to so far with the Tap Tap ?
Since the principle I the potential that had , that can to something of another way .
The world the spectacle is full of things that seem the to the other .
Is logical , to their way , all what new welcomes with caution and it a time in accepted .
There few extraordinary things , but I dare to say that Tap Tap is a of them .
The impression of someone that we is first time is clearly the compassion , is a natural reaction ...
But the compassion is completely superfluous because the people with disabilities not are beings ruins that suffer and of the we have compassion .
There people that is capable of live a full life and develop , with the condition , course , of that he of the necessary media .
I always say that if something them its well to people with disabilities , then , is not only a progress for them , but for whole the society .
Helped the fact of that is Ud. a head assignment , as you describes very people ?
If we to a work of quality , we that be rigorous in many aspects and certain demand discipline .
I that is completely normal .
Some people they with a romantic vision and with the head in the clouds and when hear that have that come two days to fraud , go to the test preparatory and to a time travelling and in concerts , the initial euphoria them or quickly .
But so is how works in all parties , in every group that to work and to something .
Currently the group the Tap Tap has twenty Member .
Many of them were already in the beginning the year 1998 ?
Only one : Láďa Angelovič .
We a open group , the people will and its , not can avoid .
Who have will and wish heart always the open doors
Will the day before the expected end the world , the Thursday 20.12.2012 to the 21 hours
Will place in the Incheba bit of Prague , in Fléda of Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and attending 12 groups and other musicians of the Republic Czech
The three cities the end of the evening to through of video for I together the song the group the Tap Tap &quot; end the world , cancelled &quot;
The aim the of is together the resources necessary for funding equipment activities the centre education barriers STUDEO in Jedličkův of Prague , whose cost out to 25 million of billion Czech .
The entry the of costs 400 CZK and the children to 12 years have free entry in the option of sale early in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the manage .
In the meeting of ministers of the countries of the agency Space European held the last week accepted to Poland as twelfth Member of the . is the second country Member of the former bloc of Europe the , after of the Republic Czech , that became in Member plenary the 12 of November of 2008 ) .
Poland set an intensive collaboration with the in the year 1994 and for the years subsequent part in the Commission of projects of the agency .
Sin however , the way of Poland towards the manage began a before .
The enthusiasts Poles already son to the flights the space before of the second war World , although not always about their work .
Remember , example , the conference of A. in the astronomic Centre of Warsaw in the 6 of December of 1933 , presented their ideas on the study pioneering &quot; introduction to the cosmonautics &quot; .
The ideas the young draughtsman ( born the 1905 ) was to the assistants indifferent and , years after , us that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only that had shown interest in their work .
In the year 1934 successful in France the Prize Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis as their &quot; introduction to the cosmonautics &quot; .
The Doctor Jan Gadomski ( 1899 - 1966 ) , mentioned before , became more later in a great drive of the exploration and of the cosmonautics .
Published hundreds of articles in Polish weeklies and wrote a series of books dedicated to this discipline scientific .
Gadomski became in a promoter of the cosmonautics , was known in all the world and their contribution to the science was rewarded when it their name to one of the of the face hidden of the order .
Already in the year 1925 was in Poland a that was to be sanctioning of an engine of rockets .
Unfortunately , unknown who was the author of the proposal and not know the project .
Not is clear if the had was to be used for the testing of the or for their slowed .
The information on this limited to the after in the press of the time .
To from the year 1933 the it Polish began to their to the rockets .
The research was funded the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with the . Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and . Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim .
To from the material retained , ago clear that research came the on of the evidence practices .
Not however , with the arrival of the troops German , was the research .
In the year 1937 about in the press specialised the injudicious of a missile of hunting designed the draughtsman Rohoziński and the year next was published the study &quot; Rakieta - I &quot; , the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki .
Both projects were for the military use of the engines for rockets .
Little before of the war , the Committee scientific provisional advisory ( Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy responsible ) of all the projects of technical of rockets for military use and all the jobs .
The Committee was founded in 1937 , but after of two years of activity , was interrupted the beginning of the war .
Other studies dedicated to the cosmonautics appeared in the press Polish after of the war thank the work of the society Polish of Astronáutica ( Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne ) .
In the edition of November of 1954 of the magazine Problemy ago reference first time to the society with four articles very they dedicated to the .
In one of them , the . M. Subotowicze , proposed the creation of a society that devoted to the cosmonautics .
In that time already had since in projects of artificial satellites and was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects of future .
Since principles of 1956 the society Polish of Astronáutica ( PTA ) hoped to be part of the Federation international of Astronáutica ( up in 1951 ) and in autumn of that same year the PTA became in Member plenary .
The year next the first President of the PTA , Kazimierz Zarankiewicz ( 1902 - 1959 ) , happened to be the of of the Federation international of Astronáutica .
Occupy this office to their death in 1959 .
To from the 1956 , the PTA part of way significantly in the development the had probe RM ( Rakieta Meteorologiczna ) , that was a success and became in the first had Polish in the was to out scientific research .
The first kind RM-1 was complete in 1957 and launched first time the 10 of October of 1958 .
The had had a of of 1.800 metres , a 80 cm of length and not unable to the 5 kg of weight .
More later , end of build the version RM-1A and in summer of 1959 were the evidence airlines of the rockets RM-2 of two stages in the desert of Błędów .
The had severs 1.4 metres and a 11.5 kg.
Another kind of had in development was to be subject of scientific real study . the had RM-34 was to have a of of 14.5 km and their mission would control the wind of all .
Sin however , in 1962 cancelled the jobs .
The successor of the first rockets the kind RM was the had Meteor-1 , that was for the years 1962 and 1965 .
Se as had of two stages , with a length total of 510 cm and a initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Se proceeded three types ( called Meteor-1A , -1B and -1C ) , that differed between the available space for the equipment scientists .
In the had Meteor-1A the available space for the volume was of 0.4 litres , in the Meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres .
The of maximum in the three types was of 37 km.
Between the years 1965 and 1968 developed in the Institute air the had Meteor-2 , whose first evidence airlines were in October of 1970 .
The had Meteor-2 had a initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of to a weight useful of 10 kg to 60 km of all .
Subsequently was the Meteor-2H version and Meteor-3 .
Is necessary mention also the entry of Poland in the COSPAR ( openly at Space Roslin ) in the year 1960 and the training the national Committee of COSPAR two years after .
In the framework the programme Interkosmos , Poland joined to the research the space on artificial Soviet satellites and , in the year 1978 , the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became in the second after of Vladimir Remek .
The from of the law on social jobs is not the solution .
The last week the who Constitutional suspended the social law .
The resolution adherents a heated discussion in the society .
Since then will interesting at the Commission existing since a point of view more broader .
The economic systems Liberals in the EU , as that in the world globalised , based in the principle of a greater economic competition and least regulation .
In result , this means that different economic forms and the economic national systems are in conflict permanent between .
The cause is in the principle the free trade and the free movement and unlimited of private capital , with with the financial speculation unbridled .
The effect of the large differences in the cost labour ( of the wages ) is economic tensions .
Under this concept is necessary understand the situation in the manufacturer , with the imports of goods cheap , is shorten travel and for this &quot; from a &quot; the price the competitor with the aim of done with the greater part the market and , of this way , increase their for of profits .
To great at means , for the majority of the employers , enterprises the production the abroad , buy there more cheap or well as . the result is a unemployment high in those countries in the price the work , in compared with other economies , is more high .
Because to that private capital not has social responsibility any and , with this , is not responsible the unemployment that phenomenon generated , overall necessarily the social expenditure the state .
Whole this situation being the total desirable of the employers pay tax and compensate the economic damage and social that have caused in their now of obtain profits .
The situation is universally so known that is not necessary it data statisticians specific .
The practices little the private capital do situations , in certain economies , in the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of reduce artificially the social level of the own population and , of this way , attract capital abroad the country .
Said of other way , the governments are private capital to available of their own population have in account the social decline .
This ago patent on all in the changes of the laws force .
The aim is force to the population to that accept the dictated the private capital , on all in what that as to the wages .
This has place , a part , by the system of economic duty in the case of unemployment of long a ; other , by the right restricted of the employees in as to rights labour .
The result is a poverty growing with with the increase of the differences between poor and rich .
Since ago a series of years , there in Germany points of over of food for poor people that not can in with their own work .
The number of people that receive this kind of aid an already the million .
In the framework the increase of the competitiveness of the economy German , is a case quite often : people employed with a wage so under that state must pay the rest for to the minimum essential for survive .
Se was public a scandal of this kind related with the situation of the employees diagnoses the Parliament Federal German .
The measures of savings of virtually all the States the southern of the EU nowhere , place to doubt , to the same situation . the people , repeated a decline of their social level , are forced to must as in the century nineteenth or to with a wage rotten in the limit of the society , with the hope of that some day it the country capital private investor .
Is necessary of where next ?
In the case of that involved of other countries of the EU , then the poverty is of a country to another or not a never , since that Chinese , Indian , brazilian , Turks , Moroccan , Egyptians or African are working a tiny part of a European wage .
This also affects to whole America Latin .
The Corporation Liberals and the media of communication claim to the all that state not should to capital to the economy , that you the economy leads to their failure .
The private capital it with tooth and European the i of that state not should intervene in the economy in the control .
To continuation , is necessary ask if the private capital not play with their egoism in the policy and , therefore , in all the state .
In this case the answer is clearly terms .
The test is the existence of lobbies , in the practice very powerful and curse , in all the States .
The result is a situation some that to in the area of the corruption , in the mutual favours , in a legislation that is virtually reprehensible in all parties but is not a .
In Germany the situation is the next : the ministries state , to lack of financial media , are the wording of projects of law to legal private companies , the which are to often linked with the industry .
This kind of projects of law are adopted after in the Bundestag , the Parliament German .
Of this way , all the power not from the people , such and as is in the constitutions of the democracies Western , but of the strong financial groups that represent their own interests .
Is obvious that democracies with a it liberal are quickly in a situation how the describes Appiános in their labour the crisis of the Republic Roman in times of Caesar and Pompeya : &quot; the state was time and the administrations within to the force &quot; .
To change of bribery , favours and and aid for funding stones or functionaries .
The admissions and the corruption spread from one and the people on to the ballot with the vote of advance &quot; ... &quot; not had people with nature that to a since in the administration , so a time , to cause of this dear , the state was eight months consuls &quot; ... &quot; began to hears in seriously of that only no for a situation so serious was the autocracy and that was necessary decisions a man extremely &quot; ... although Appiános i in Pompeya , Caesar by the power and transformed the democracy for always in autocracy .
The conclusion , the same way that in the old , is that current society on in insensitive preference the individual benefit have in account the common interests .
The private capital is not capable , in their essence , of understand and ombudsman the profits of whole the society .
The result is the same that of then , a quickly of the elite unprecedented , that she an effort for them in depth .
The causes the on of the regimes fascist and Communist must other , what therefore , in the liberalisation unbridled of the economic systems in the century nineteenth and which .
With respect to the current situation , is possible be the disappearance of these systems in benefit of a democracy of kind liberal , as a pause defined , to the expected the next coup .
The fact really is that elite current ignores completely the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives , social disasters and humanitarian of the we been witnessing , so as the crimes against the humanity , such and as the we in the history former and the more recent .
The from of the law on public tenders is not the solution ; the least not to long term .
Under pressure of the economic competition , therefore to level international as within of the EU , the government of the Republic Czech be forced to to for other to for reduce the social level of the population .
This trend is , what therefore , systemic .
The solution is specific reforms , that strengthen therefore the participation the capital the state as the influence of the citizens in the government and that weaken the position of monopoly the private capital in the society in benefit the state .
Israel : the laboratory the chaos .
&quot; that deforestation and could &quot; ( not from nothing of the violence and nothing could do ) , Sting in their song Fragile and whose He &quot; Let &apos; at do we not .ubjects &quot; ( we not .orget of what fragile that we ) .
&quot; if my children is not wars , not would no &quot; Gutele Schnaper , wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild , in their bed of death in the year 1849 .
After of the last waves of violence between Israel and the Strip of Gaza , have that , as always , various reactions .
A , the on of Israel , it to favour the right of is and to the Palestinians in the role of terrorists . the other supports to the Palestinians and referendums racism part the state of Israel , genocide by against Arab Palestinians and accordingly to Israel of state terrorist .
Not i to in who is guilty of the massacres that are regular and who is the victim . the end and the out , the citizens of today in day of Israel , including the territories false , born within of the situation policy current and not lived the beginning of the violence .
My intention is offer to the readers a look behind the curtain , a look for be who out from of the tensions that prevails since ago 95 years ( calculated to from of the statement prejudice in November of 1917 ) in a small surface of land the East a .
Some of my considerations based in historical facts , other in conclusions to the I come on the basis of my own way of understand the issue , on who or what group of people is the drive main of the events of the history modern .
In the history of the humanity the history of the struggles the power is in first class .
In every time we find a Great Great or a Rostopchine .
But what that already is not so clear is if always were these eventual the with their steps of way deliver or if behind of their seat had someone that their actions towards a particular aim .
We accept that we in a time that with the wealth the world in the hands of a few individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power that means , not has been to in a single generation .
Of between these families richest least a that could be the more prominent ( if still there someone behind , not what know , but not what May ) : the Rothschild .
Not says a to close of them .
Course .
In the years 90 the century nineteenth bought the first agency of news ( Jazeera ) for that any of with their name with criminal acts of very serious . the power and the wealth , or both , them portions the back , thing that for them always meant a just .
Have financially important in almost all the central banks the world and in those countries in the not are represented , has declared or is about a war : before the attack to Afghanistan were 7 countries , after the attack of Iraq were 5 , after of bring to Gaddafi only they four , but meantime Russia has counts the Bank Central the government Russian .
All at that has tried against to this family has died .
Abraham is refused to renew the state the Bank Central Bank of America of the Rothschild , began for the war of Secession to print money and was murdered in 1865 in the theatre .
Fanciful started to print money and wanted decision the system of reserve Federal ( States ) and was murdered in 1963 ; the Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned the year 1936 after of to exceeding to the States have outrage the great economic crisis the year 1929 .
Their now the power World them was for the years 1859 - 1871 to out a plan with three wars world , designed the Albert Pike , François with the degree 33 .
The first war espoused as aim eliminate the large States in whole Europe ; the second wanted eliminate the was colonial , especially of great Britain , and the third proposed reduce the population of the land between a million and billion million of people ( such amount of slave for their welfare and luxury would and not many resources ) , also of the creation of a religion universal ( the is not nothing more a draft for such solution ) and the final adoption of the powers resounding .
The method with the operates the group of the families more richest , with with the Rothschild , still the dynamic the releasing of crisis and the of send of a solution ( - order to from the chaos ) .
These solutions are , however , flawed , and threat always a worsening of the situation . if not , enough remember that States was created for that not repetition a crisis as the year 1907 .
So that , after the success the murder the as the seat austro-húngaro , which Ferdinand , in Sarajevo and after of that , to as of this , erupted the first war World , tore the Russia having with the beginning of the revolution flank .
The first war World over of way unexpectedly and unjustified since the point of view military and economic , the capitulation of Germany ( the wars for end with the Russia having were already unnecessary ) and the of firstly of the great power of Europe Central , the empire Austro-Húngaro .
For preparation the ground of the second war World , allowed that bankers and political palette , of way bloodless , a situation over to as of the enormous – of war imposed on Germany , with what that were the conditions privileged for the radicalisation of the there impoverished . subsequently , them sufficient with them to the Germans the solution the Führer , that was what enough strong and simple and that to guilty , and build after a Czechoslovakia states several Ukrainians with a strong minority German that should represent and was so well the role of the fifth spine , that is and resulted the outbreak of the war .
The end the century nineteenth , the Rothschild the foundation the movement , a that hoped to the training of a state Jewish , out in the region of the former Judea with Jerusalem as capital ( return the Sión ) .
The statement prejudice this before did the foundation for the immigration mass of Jews to Palestine and they the first conflicts with the population Arab the place .
Se were attacks terrorists in both parties .
Estalló the second war World : is difficult know if Hitler consigned too of the be to the what they control the bankers international in a principle or if all what that was was part of a plan . Sin however , the suffering of the Jews European in the camps of concentration was the conditions privileged for the acceptance the state Jewish in the society World .
Israel was founded officially in 1948 and , of way similar the way in that – of war imposed to Germany emerge the way towards the second war World , with the proclamation the state of Israel was the spotlight for a third war .
If the international bankers succeed , the nation Jewish , the as that in the second war World , would in victim in first line of combat , now with with the population Arab or , generally , Muslim the East a .
Israel is a laboratory in , a machine of solder and chaos , not only in the framework of their country , but also to at international . take as example how into of way totally the and opponents of Israel .
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the conflict palestino-israelí ? where the injustice marginalization injustice in a spiral of violence chestnut , if the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their now the power World ?
In this point is necessary distinction between the inhabitants of Israel and their authorised , because , the as that is in our country , the international bankers only have to their candidates in the elections .
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of political fascist , marketing to the international bankers , that ago all what possible for on the war to Iran and , at that Iran is Member of the organisation of cooperation of Shanghai ( China , India , Russia , Pakistan ... ) , threaten in become in a global conflict and , if we in account that Iran controls the close of Ormuz , where is the 20 % of all the oil World ( the corridor of navigation has only two miles of wide ) , would to the destruction of the economy World .
Under what light show now the words that them David Rockefeller in 1994 : &quot; what only that need is a crisis general and the people will of agreement with a new order World . &quot;
The new order World in their imagination is a world of Mr and slave .
A world in the rest of the population it to a handful of people that are part of the financial aristocracy well accommodated .
A world in the to every new individual you up a chip the been that controls all their be .
&quot; and forced to all , small and large , rich and poor , free and slave , to have a mark in the hand right or in the with , to not power buy not sell , to not be that will the name of this monster or the figures of their name .
Is necessary understand : who have two it of with , that follow the numbers of this monster .
The number mark to the person and this number is sixty and six &quot; .
Film element : if being oil , have to Hollywood
In November of 1979 a group of the demonstration of students Islamists took the Embassy American in Tehran and took 52 as hostage .
Their we in freedom was to be to change the supporting Réza Páhlevi , the which after of the revolution orhan to EE.UU , country that had their regime for decades .
For the administration American the situation not themselves no positive perspective : throwing the be not what could allow , since that , if what was , disposal in danger the confidence of their allies in other countries .
But the we in freedom of the hostage in Iran , where the revolution had led in the constitution the theocratic regime , not was to their reach .
Was a coup the prestige of the States United , that subsequently intensified still more with the attempt failed of release to the hostage the force .
The diplomats they were released 444 days after of the intervention negotiating the government of Algeria .
In EE.UU. , their destination was a wave of solidarity and bear against Iran .
The failure in Iran played of decisive way to the defeat of argues argues with Ronald Ronald in the presidential elections of 1980 .
The film &quot; element &quot; the director and actor Ben Affleck an episode of this history , a small success for America .
Little before of should the Embassy , escaped six employees the building .
After of a complicated , ended in the residence of the Embassy Canadian .
Cia , in collaboration with the authorities Canadians , managed extract of Iran , for this helped a history Sky a point : forthcoming with passports Canadians , as Member the team film that at the which in the country for the making of a Who of science fiction .
Combination of up
The plan that Bourlanges the expert in &quot; &quot; Toni Mendez be the collaboration of Hollywood .
For that lie prompt divulged , wrote on the project film in weeklies specialist , organised conferences of press , the society of virtual production had even a clearance real .
The details on the operation together in secret for a time , the film has fact to from of the memories of Tony Mendez .
The film of Affleck is a combination odd of several up .
Por a on , a political realistic ; another , a called &quot; &quot; , the history of an episode that went well , a deception ( an example can be the series Ocean &apos; at push ) .
In the film combined the States of mind . we a on well it of Tehran . in the sequence of appropriations show photographs flagship of the time of the events , that were the same way in the film ; not there many differences to this regard .
Por the another , authoritarian scenes of Hollywood a therefore more , marked the irony and a excessive corner .
And also , scenes of the Central of the CIA and other institutions : men that you the situation in the table of negotiations , in the corridors of the office , telephone ...
Ben Affleck has managed restart their career of a way excellent .
The actor , that had been subject of ridiculed , has become in a director on and their way of act has longer of be the white of ironic comments .
Element is their third , after of &quot; small goodbye , goodbye &quot; ( 2007 ) and the &quot; the Town . city of honour &quot; ( 2010 ) .
The same time , is the first film of Affleck in the action not has place in the city of Boston , where it .
Also , the sensitivity of warrant the atmosphere the place was a feature that light to the directors of old films above of standards of Hollywood .
And Affleck what shows in element , where Tehran &quot; wheel &quot; in Canada .
The best scenes of the film have place in the streets , in the reconstruction of the events reported . the sequence introductory of the of the Embassy is impressive their capacity the same time , the taught the confusion and of the lack of foresight that from when , in some place , the history a step forward .
Affleck and their colleagues obtaining an similar effect in the scenes proceeded ( the team in the bazaar of Tehran ) .
Too action in many places
The director had that accept the fact of a history explained not offers a in the sense film of the scenes more penalised .
And the you quite well . to sometimes you adds something to the reality : here not its all of way so you ( the scene in that which the crisis in the airport of Tehran , the handicap of a call to America and the for unbridled after their back become in a madness ) .
The of element is the havoc that from of the need of show too action in many places .
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a role very funny as colleagues of Hollywood , although their eventual deserved more space and not are , not a least , the only in this .
Por these for , the film of Affleck lose a little of further dramatic , but is a that can to with an interest moderate , appreciate their realisation and the lifestyle of a that appealing the years 70 .
But that collapse , that will difficult .
As reminder of a history real and as test of what excessive that can be the outmoded of and of the services secret , is enough .
Rules for the of much , bananas and circus
The servant www.bankovnipoplatky.com , that every year is a survey on the rates bank more absurd , now has decided announced the on &quot; the regulation or the ideas more absurd the workshop of the EU &quot; .
&quot; Se we happened after the last event , the EU has to approve a share the 40 cent of women in jobs of direction in the large companies European &quot; , he Právo bluntly Nacher , the whoever of the survey .
Between the is , example , the recent decision the Court European of unifying the policies of insurance between men and women .
To now , the women of best prices in the insurance of life because represent objective a risk will .
other &quot; ideas belief the workshop of the EU can be proposals the people to end of this year &quot; .
The election will place to end the month of February of 2013 &quot; , informed Nacher .
Between the controversial regulations of the EU is , example , the addition compulsory of the fuel that , as result , harms the environment ; other ban is the use of the thermometers of mercury of whole the life only because contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the deleted the size of the cages of the hens , that has contributed the considerable increase the price of the eggs this year .
Se has criticised the ban proving of use the expression &quot; butter of it &quot; or the withdrawal of the classical garage of the shops .
A banana of quality must have a length of 14 centimetres .
The would of the Union the kind of decisions to often under the pressure of one or another lobby law or industrial , whose petitions in Brussels are stood normally some state or group of States ( the Republic Czech , even with the threat of veto , eye the demands of their banks ) .
The interests of a lobby were behind of the request , example , of that bananas of greater quality be have in the EU a length of what least 14 centimetres and not could it &quot; shifting &quot; .
The Commission European for saying that with this only search harmonisation the national rules not to the date , that only their marketing .
The rules that do reference to fruit and vegetables in the EU , to despite of the opposition of some States , have no on the basis of that directive existing means a waste of grocery .
The candidate to earn the survey could be the site of the EU the last year according the which in the much that market is compulsory have that children age of 8 years not are authorised to the supervision of an adult .
The EU was reference here to a study American according the which , when about of toys , the much are the main cause of death child serves .
Also is existing a similar restriction applies the use of part of children of to 14 years .
Ocurrencias born even in our country
Also absurd is the regulation which to the European officials : all at that have any role official in the EU not can use the designation of Macedonia . for not hurt the sensitivity of Greece , must about of FYROM ( FYROM FYROM FYROM of Macedonia ) .
The servant Bankovnípoplatky.com , in collaboration with the partnership of economists Liberals Laissez Faire , in the survey , between some proposals absurd mentioned more down , the site of the Union on the volume of the has of food in the territory of a state Member .
The EU the volumes were of has of food that can technically in the territory of the Republic Czech the same day of our entry to the EU .
After , the Republic Czech estimated , example , the volume established for in retains , what that you a threat of fined substantial .
To the organizers of the survey also them was the commonplace of pay to those countries that not have access the sea and the idea of give a subsidy for the request of subsidies .
This class of ideas not arose in Brussels but in Prague .
&quot; we in disadvantage the fact of not have sea .
We to the Union European a compensation &quot; , declared in autumn the 2004 the then Minister of agriculture Jaroslav Palas ( ) .
What alleged with the fact of that in our country was a crop and , as result of the on purchases of intervention , the state had the stores in and had that export .
According Palas , given that Republic Czech is far of the ports seaports , the EU should hundreds of million of EUR .
The end , the Commission European was ready to help to the Republic Czech and organised a public for the buying the crop of the countries that not have access the sea .
The subsidy for receive a subsidy was proposal to the municipalities the Ministry for the development local at the Minister Pavel Němec ( US-DEU ) . specifically , is a to the wording of applications of subsidies of Brussels .
Eu : the decided rare are an exception
The guidelines of the States Member are to often white of criticisms , the efforts of the EU in on of there and , also , a functioning and development more they in whole the Union deserve more well , according several experts , our recognition .
According the experts , the problem more serious is , example , the collection of subsidies of the EU for projects that not have nothing that see with the deepening of the integration European , but that States Member have managed in the negotiations on budgets .
To the Czech also them it the very sensitive , the same way that to other countries of the Union , the fight the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products , although our country not always has out DE of these .
The Czech , after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrian , flank with success the designation of origin the of Olomouc , but had that christening the name the national rum , whose tradition in our country back the century nineteenth , and happened to unfair &quot; &quot; .
Only the products processing to from the abroad of cane of sugar can be runs rum , but not those facts to from of beet of sugar .
In the consideration official of geographical of origin protected of the EU , with with the fruits from and gorgonzola known in all the world , the of the city German Lübeck or the ham of ham , already are example the shortbread of resort resort , the of Pohořelice and of Třeboň and , even , the variety of hop of .
As protected of the EU , will be proud the bread of of Pardubice and the resort of Hořice Greens Podkrkonoší .
The people to that save the Republic , but am an amateur , says Okamura
Mr Senator , how you happened stand to the elections for President ?
Not is of be Senator or President .
If in our country outside all well , then not would my candidacy .
But already not can bear see how condemn in the last twenty years in our country , how the honour are go , increase the tax and the age of retirement .
Not had ambitions of be political .
When see something that not I like , attempt to with a solution for .
And since that already have forty years and my candidacy is independent , the only possibility that have of change the things is coming as Senator or President .
The Senate already has come , but little after has since in way towards the Presidency .
Not is giving the on to those people that what have voted ?
Always I that my candidacy to the Presidency depended of the results in the elections the Senate .
More later that if was elected Senator , would my candidacy to the Presidency .
But my aim is not the role ; the role is the tool with the can to reality my own ideas .
Por that need the greater possible influence and the mandate more strong possible .
The problem is not only that us a nation that criticize in the bar or front of the television , but that to who that wants to a change .
To this you fallen the media of communication , that you discredit and who the freedom of expression with the freedom of lie .
Of me says that I to journalists or that I been advisory of Jiří Jiří .
We to about of their ideas .
Se is to the presidential fight with i financial and criminal responsibilities of political and the statement of the property above of twenty million .
For this must change the law .
As President not has this competition and only the Senate in their whole can propose laws .
How to it ?
As citizen , I have part of a group of pressure for that profession of on recognise as work be , and what we .
The problem is in the policy : if someone a with a good proposal , already be of right or of left , this to purpose and this affects to the citizens .
As candidate independent , have of a greater potential for obtain the support of all the groups Members .
Sin not undistorted of party , have the capacity of power decisions something of every party that be better for our country and apply .
Se as more well a man of right or of left ?
Since the point of view Czech , have the impression that people I as more of left .
For me not has importance , already be a little of left or a little of right .
What that I care is that want forward .
Not I care if someone is of right or of left , i bring to the people .
Always support openly any solution good , regardless of if the proposal next the KSČM or of the ODS and , the same way , I in against of the poor ideas .
Ago joke when says of Ud. that is populist .
But not what is proving with what that says ?
When creates a plan business for the company , you also certain objectives and ideals .
And to them .
Will who what something populism , but all the proposals of the i already work in the world or known experts speak of them .
But the support the Parliament only you are slogans .
And with this not can survive in the policy to long term .
Or believes you that if at to the people and about with them , will , example , a responsibility criminal and financial ?
Not have other option .
To to political , to journalists and to the society civil and try them of my part for this .
If outside elected President , not would problem in organise a broadcasting in direct television in the which would to the leaders of the parties Members that responsibility criminal and financial for political , officials , judges and tax the state .
And , eventually , them should that communicate why not what want .
If there a strong like that out the disputes , can to pressure in the scene policy .
Take case the election direct the President , that has been an achievement of the pressure public .
The same time tell that only am an amateur , not am not an out not an intellectual .
For my views and ideals attempt to allies .
Just of start in the policy and attempt obtain the greater possible support for my programme .
Attempt from the things forward I same , but in case of that not it well , within of six years what contribution and back the private sector .
Sounds a little as if Okamura outside to save the Republic Czech .
Not am no Salvador .
Know that with a person not I nothing , that I visited to a series of personalities known , if to what better to it their candidacy the Senate .
I to see to Radim Jančura , but refused because had a work .
Por my part , what least I supported to the journalist of research Jana Lorencová , that his to the light the fraud with fruits covered of heating .
I I that of the basis of that people is really dissatisfied , now am in the balance .
The sixty cent of the population not out to the ballot and , those that what did , voted to the representatives the wake .
In the Senate we two the sector independent .
The people was the Senate , of such way that will complicated achieve changes .
Sin however , I defend my own ideas , as example the election direct of mayors or of governors .
Is at be their own party ?
Still not what I have because not have time for this , for check the last unblemished of every one of the potential Member the party , not have money .
Not have money not for the campaign to the Presidency , in my account transparent only there 20.000 billion .
Not has money ?
About of statements of the property , how is the their ?
Clarification my private property in a 60 million .
In Prague have a ground valued in 25 million , an out valued ten million , another out in eight million , a now of works of art with a value of ten million , a Aston Martin of a 3.5 million and a Superb valued in a million , and in the account have a couple of million .
Por true , have a Aston Martin because was my dream of young . always I pleased James Bond , that seeing this car , was with the women and , the same time , elites against the and injustices .
Leads a Aston Martin , their property is valued in 60 million and not has money for the campaign ?
Ud. says that to change the Republic but not to to too money of their part .
Not is very convincing .
Not have 15 million for the campaign .
Have that ?
In the campaign already I since 2.5 million .
The fact of that not have no shows that not there too interest in my programme .
And not have the duty of pay the campaign with money of my pocket .
The expenditure of the campaign cover in essence what that get in concept of salary of Senator .
But not could live of this . Por example , not could pay to my son the school English , that costs 30.000 billion month .
If like only earn money , then not I would as candidate .
So that will with their activity business for power live ?
Not has said before that was to to this activity ?
This not has nothing that see with a salary greater .
As I promised , in part I longer my activities .
Por example , the representative of my agency of travel will to be my substitute in spring .
The people would that outside the Republic .
But I also need live of something .
How strings to earn monthly as his ?
Between 200.000 and 400.000 , that I gaining .
If outside President , then cease the business .
Can put whole the interview in the edition the Saturday of Práva .
The study of architecture MVRDV shows that real adventures not only are in the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the would despite &quot; mountain of books &quot; - 2 photos
&quot; i that building is fun , has an aspect , and end there something interesting that see &quot; , says Lisette Verhaig , a killed that is the street .
And stefan Spermon , technical of you in a great company on close of the library , as : &quot; also , the building is it &quot; .
But I I wonder for what need a library today in day .
All we Internet , chlorine and electronic books .
Nobody will will in these libraries past of fashionable , not ?
Spijkenisse , a city bedroom on to the doors of suggestion that hardly deserves a visit , holds the questionable honour of have levies with a record for forget .
The population of 80.000 inhabitants is the rate of literacy more low of the countries Netherlands .
For to this situation so scandal , ago some years decided make of any way to the culture general and imitation the seven bridges fake that officer represented in the notes of euro in way of of concrete arm .
The success of the for amusing was limited .
And so was as the responsible political you that only there a possibility for improve the statistics : ! had that build a library !
Winy Maas , the study of architecture Dutch MVRDV , all a master in the art of the of bars and responsible of funny buildings to the couple that Commonwealth , took the issue with their her calm and lively to the presentation the in the year 2003 with five books under the it and a Around in the face .
And while the jury telescope Oswiecim to their around and of shoulders , Maas were to up the books size its a pyramid and brought their brief speech with the following words : &quot; ladies fellow :
Here the you , my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse , the which &apos; &quot; .
Nine years after , the mountain of 30 million of EUR comments in the place to .
This way part the project of revival , that full with a parking underground , a supermarket , an office of post and a couple of buildings of housing and .
To principles of November the mountain of books was medallists with the second Prize &quot; Impact Library of NL 2012 &quot; .
Also , the project also is the &quot; Dutch National Wood Award 2012 &quot; .
Of this way , the small city sake of history , that to the date not had nothing more that offer an area smartest and a City incredibly fingers after whose on White one more well a Central country , account now with a labour of contemporary architecture .
But on all , Spijkenisse at now the first cultural public building of their history .
The long way to the book
The first impression is that is of a paradise of books under a .
Well is true that there a lift that we transported fair the centre of this poisoned , but the real achieve the space and the reading not what use , but that prefer with their to every step of their escalation to the top .
The internal completely is bright and easy of cover with the view , the soil of mortar and the elegant support of way unequivocally the condition public of the library .
The environment urban is perfect .
The raise the view can to to the banks the park , the dogs and the children and girls playing the football .
And all both books , books and more books .
&quot; normally the shelves of books are willing to what long of the on and in the centre opens a huge room whites that , what general , is be something be and impersonal &quot; , says Winy Maas .
What that we fact us is to this down the classical configuration Space and from the area of reading the internal the foreign .
The internal of the mountain is very well tapped : in the are the offices , the library of Internet , the club of being , the centre of environmental education and the room of peacekeeping .
Is special deserve the shelves this tries the duties of coating , and the same time .
The view , the you and the are strangers .
Even the architects and the engineers civilians more the day shake the head when already about of this material unknown .
&quot; we work with materials recycled &quot; , we Joop Trouborst , head the project in the city of Spijkenisse .
And so is as a day , in an agricultural exploitation , we brings with the animal appropriate from of the agriculture .
Since ago many years , in the greenhouses and in the camps of the countries Netherlands used a fabric plastic of cable scarce of thick as basis for the roots of the crops .
Se is of a material cheap and efficient .
This fabric fine hard two stations and after battled .
For the library this fabric , first time in such quantities , to to revised of four centimetres of thick .
With the heat and the pressure , the of plastic agricultural ( KLP ) time of colour and becomes in a material dark , harmonised and durable that of to a of new car and of sport .
After 105 corridor a to the top of the mountain .
The end of this route continual of almost 500 metres around of the mountain we facing the to : since the cafeteria not only has a fantastic view of the city , but that in she also can enjoy of a famous beside and their GM in enormous flower .
These do an environment a to the couple that are the content air appropriate for this mountain of literature .
Donations for a new soul
&quot; although costs believe in their large land as , this building is a project exemplary in what that as to the ecology &quot; , out Trouborst .
The heating and the necessary cooling are to from of geothermal energy .
To despite of that mountain of books is on under a huge pyramid of glass , even in the days more the sun only which for few hours in their internal .
The enormous of wood a in sense mind to the on of glass serve for to shadow and indicating the majority of the rays the sun .
This creates a internal climate .
The rest is thing of the pulled it .
Stefan Spermon , the scepticism worker the sector of the technologies of the information , already has courage to to the ordinary in the new library .
And Lisette Verhaig also has state there .
Also , the teacher of traditional medicine China her Bogarde has visited the library . she described the &quot; Boekenberg &quot; as the &quot; soul mention &quot; of Spijkenisse .
The reason is that , with reason of the opening that had place ago a couple of weeks , invited to all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book of their now private .
Of this way to fill , of time , the missed of a library that still not account with their archive completely ; in the today has 70.000 copies .
The concept has sure noticed .
The shelves are teem .
&quot; not there nothing worst a library an empty &quot; , says the architect Winy Maas .
&quot; i that thank to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a true link with this building .
All know that their book way part of the library .
Although only is there for embellish .
Of this way , the study MVRDV has managed all a success in that discipline as that in the specialises known as &quot; creation of an identity &quot; .
The city of Spijkenisse has writing a part of the history of the literature .
Regardless of what young and that can be .
Por end a point of starting for shaping their identity .
Szabo : &quot; the Germans must play a role more leading &quot;
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine .
According instigation Szabo , expert in the relations US . UU.-Europa , this at to Berlin in a diplomatic position quite tricky .
Deutsche Welle : to principles of week , Germany was to understand that would in against of the proposal of give to the territories Palestinians the condition of state observer of the nations UN .
Sin however , finally Berlin abstained .
Por what ?
Instigation Szabo : Germany not supports what that Israelis have fact in Gaza .
Now well , because to the special relationship that unite the country with Israel , Germany must have care .
But the same time i that not supports the position American .
Germany wanted demonstrate their independence be too criticism with Israel .
For the embargo that had place in Libya in March of 2011 , Germany also abstained when of what that was was of establish an area of ban of flight .
This has been avowed finally the NATO .
You is difficult to Germany adopt a position clear when are in at international important subjects ?
Sí , so is .
This must to that in these at is hindrance their foreign policy , moving of a policy led , so say , the States United and on in a foreign German policy .
And what that difficult still more the things is that European not have a policy coherent and uniform .
Por what therefore , the Germans are in a crossroads .
Of them expected that play a role more independent , but not are used to do .
I that still are operating what will their role , but already have on the way towards a foreign policy normal &quot; &quot; .
A foreign similar policy to the countries as France or great Britain .
What means specifically a foreign policy normal &quot; &quot; since the point of view German ?
Is a policy that , when is of national interests , shows ready to defend different clash to the of States United or their European partners .
I that foreign German policy is a strong motivation in the economic policy , is say , in the exports and in their relations with certain regions , as can be Russia , China or next East .
The economic interests Germans are to true different point to the of other large powers and that reason Germany must protect their interests .
These economic interests have affected in the position adopted with regard the conflict in East next and in the vote of the UN ?
Por a on , Germany account with large markets in next East , especially in the Gulf .
Por this reason must be poppy and not alienate of the opinion public Arab not of the élite Arab .
This is important , course .
But I not you would so importance since that is not of a relationship completely unilateral .
Sin however , play a role fundamental in the considerations German .
Has attacked Germany their relationship with US . UU. the abstain of vote in important decisions as in the vote on Palestine ?
I that in Europe , and even in States United , the position German degree of a huge degree of understanding .
Por this reason , not i that has been a break so drastic as in the case of Libya .
Perhaps with this Germany has achieved Leman a true respect .
The end and the out , all this not has fact but demonstrate that is a country the take in seriously as international actor and whose interests there that have in account .
In Europe there different views about of the initiative Palestine .
In change , US . UU. has shown clearly to favour of a veto .
There differences of views between US . UU. and many European nations ?
Always have been these disparities because to the internal policy US .
I that government of Obama shows in secret a great understanding towards the position European .
But , to cause of the situation policy that lives here , is clear that government not can defend in public that position .
I that real differences of views not has in reality the which that you attaches .
If we the relations between Obama and the first Minister Israeli Netanyahu , we that Obama is not for nothing himself with the policy that develops .
You is difficult to Germany reconcile the links relations that in with Israel and States United , a on , with the position of their main partners in the EU , another ?
I that is precisely that what that ago that be so difficult for the Germans .
Por course that would a little more easy for the Germans if existed a European policy coherent and allowing , but is not the case .
Por what therefore , not have the possibility of be part of a Spain higher , but that must promote the things since their own position .
That is precisely what that are doing now with the euro .
I that in the future Germany will a role of leadership to the time of force to Europe to adopt a European position .
Por course that is not easy nothing for Germany , already be simply the relationship that in with Israel .
This has been always an issue handles .
But i that Germans have clear that must play the role of on independent .
Se is Germany to same in the role of international important actor ? to in reality Germany in a role leading ?
Or perhaps you still underdeveloped difficult accept that leadership ?
Germany still not has have , always is something you and , for obvious , the country you still collapse play a role more important .
If we the crisis the euro , example , we that every time that Germany I as actor main , when certain feelings .
This is not easy for the Germans .
Se is of an old problem and is that nobody to be surrounded of the countries enemies .
Seen of this way , Germany is in a position a more difficult that States United .
Must show an attitude inclusive with to the different neighbours and views and that is not easy .
The influence of US . UU. in the policy European ever every time more , but the EU not cover of time that we , who is then ?
To the Germans not them will more no that in a role more leading .
Even if not them like , if them is unpleasant or if them becomes in a people still more unpopular , c &apos; la the vie !

&quot; protection of trademark &quot; in China : when Puma and drunk become of suddenly in Chinese trademark
Drunk is a mark known to level World and side Ralph Lauren also .
But , what is drunk side ?
After this name behind a designation EU officially in China but that not has nothing that see with the original companies .
Not however , this degree of protection while the real not be a demand .
And even then is not clear that them will to to the reason .
&quot; to the foreign them is every time more difficult protect their trademark in China &quot; , out he Pattloch , lawyer the Wessing specialises in violations of rights of protection in extreme East .
Every week a to my table a new case .
The imitators simply in a couple of you for power record their trademark .
Of this way , Gucci becomes in Lu-Gucci and in place of Prada with Prada-Kny .
The companies German also copied legally of the same way , such and as you has happened the manufacturer of articles sports Puma .
Pattloch opens a locked in the have seats of the office of trademark of Beijing .
The 14 of September of 2010 a company China which record the mark Zegna DF Puma , a name artificial that also i of the home of fashionable Ermenegildo Zegna .
That Chinese are champions world in that of imitation and of all the rights of intellectual property is of too known .
In the large cities there large stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeiting .
Sin however , the cases of Pattloch are of other a . Por charge of their customers , he fight against the fact of that office of trademark granted of way official to the Chinese companies the right to from from of a designation that already is EU in another place .
The Chinese what refer &quot; bang Ming Pai &quot; or mark his .
The word has their origin in the term Chinese &quot; bang Dakuan &quot; ,
That ago reference to women that have &quot; fish &quot; to a man Puerto .
The Chinese authorities not feel guilty
&quot; is harmful for the business , there that fight against this &quot; , requires Pattloch .
&quot; the mark ago waters , the position monopolist disappears and the damage that suffering the image is huge . &quot;
The financial losses and the as procedural of the sectors affected are , on all in the case of products flagship of luxury .
According data of the company of analysis of market CLSA , with a volume of 15.000 million of EUR the year China is , in size , the third market of articles of luxury and the overall to greater pace .
Sin however , achieve the seeking of enrolment of doubtful legality in the registration of trademark is complicated and also is a money .
The processes can over to nine years and the result is uncertain .
Pattloch about of cases in the Court rejected a demand because had Objective therefore time that name subject of the demand already had become in a &quot; reality of market &quot; .
&quot; if the they has bad fortunately , perhaps even have that pay money the because the process has damage to the mark of this in China &quot; , out Pattloch .
In times this is the law of the jungle .
Some of the cases more known have that see with graphic elements .
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a he against the manufacturer of machinery of construction Sany , the company that has been taken ago little the manufacturer German of bombs of concrete Putzmeister .
Por that to day of today the Chinese can to being an emblem very similar to the star of Mercedes .
The one of Volvo , Geely , his the principle a logo in white and Blue that us in great measure to BMW ; the issue in the courts and Geely had that happened .
The manufacturer of clothes Lacoste lost in China against imitators from of Hong Hong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile eye in the direction opposite the original .
The Chinese authorities not feel guilty .
The office of trademark CTMO in Beijing recognised that in 2010 have had difficulties because to the shortage of equipment and funding of personal .
The last year , however , &quot; the situation of emergency labour the to the as &quot; .
Of this way , the amount of processes of complaint has small in a 22 % .
Almost 57.000 of these cases worked been , a 75 % more that previous year .
Sin however , 81.500 complaints are outstanding of resolution .
Fight against this costs a money
As is be her in China , the figures are surprising .
The last year the CTMO registered more of 1.4 million of applications of protection of trademark , almost a third more that in 2010 .
Se would of a new record and means that China tenth year running the list of new enrolment in all the world , according out the office of trademark .
Seems that also happens with the number of which valid , figure that out to 5.5 million in total .
In 2011 would 1.800 million of typhoon in concept of rights .
Said of other way , this means that of average every for costs 1.280 typhoon or 160 EUR .
Fight against this costs a money , such and as shows the case of the company family German Freudenberg .
Since ago more of seven years the group principal in the courts against a Chinese .
If well the Germans have managed stop the manufacture illegal of parts of car of imitation ,
The has achieved ensure the Chinese rights on the mark Freudenberg .
&quot; us ourselves we caused this situation because in Germany the surnames not are protected &quot; , out Hanno Wentzler , President and Consejero Delegado of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich .
The office of trademark CTMO also rejected the appeal of the .
In the two following bodies you have given the reason to Freudenberg , but the part opposite still fronts in the today .
There that have great care
Now the case has come to the doors the Court higher of justice , where still outstanding of resolution .
Wentzler responding in power resolve welcome the question and rationale the professionalism of the courts .
Sin however , also says that &quot; the procedure is extremely expensive , therefore in terms of money as of time &quot; .
Is difficult estimate the internal costs ; the archive business has had that review dossiers of to hundred years of old for power to evidence .
Ago five years Freudenberg promised to the part opposite a &quot; sum of six figures in EUR &quot; with the aim of to to an agreement friendly , but not had success .
&quot; this shows what a that we care &quot; , out Wentzler .
The dangers that dictatorial in extreme East threat even with affect to Europe ,
Specifically if the imitators they there the rights on trademark not protected .
So , a Chinese manufacturer tried record in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and products of fur .
Ago time that group occasion this area trade , not however in prevent the for .
&quot; there that great have care &quot; , says Wentzler .
Therefore he as the lawyer Pattloch proposed to the companies German that are extremely careful to the time of to business with China .
Not enough with rely in the international legislation on rights of mark , but that what that there that to is &quot; record also in China all for that can be for of protection &quot; , such and as as Wentzler .
Of what contrary , the issue can be a more expensive a simple registration .
Of fact , in case of that Freudenberg scenario the last assault of their particular battle , then would that pay to the part opposite rights of licence their own name , such and as it Wentzler .
That or in the segment in question we the market .
Day World of the fight against the AIDS : dance , I , help
In Druckmaschinen trying the chorus Imbongi and in Swaziland delighted the orphans the AIDS
The history of a capable link of that overcome a more of 8.733 kilometres of distance .
First starts the floor : you of , slippers of in , shoes of and for the compass on the soil of , and what are quickly .
A , two , three , four .
Only then start to slowly the voices of the singers ( , under , statement and ) , , and a to other .
And Fiete Hopf , the director of 29 years , threat with trick almost of their skilled the try to order with their bold gestures and into .
Is Monday the later and in the room of music the Institute of Psicología medical of Druckmaschinen the chorus Imbongi trying a new song .
Also have come the fifty singers , of between 23 and 69 years , since the human to the looking of home .
&quot; Om &apos; Obani &quot; is not an easy , every voice the chorus has a text different and also in a foreign language hardly known : a language about eleven million of people in Africa , botswana , Lesotho , Malawi , Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland .
Aid for the is
According an estimate of UNAIDS , the programme of the nations UN for the fight against the AIDS , in all the world there approximately 34 million of people infected the virus the HIV .
23.5 million of them live in the southern of Africa .
In Swaziland there 245.000 orphans the AIDS .
More the 40 % of the population already is positive .
The partnership Voices at Africa has found in Germany peacemaker for the 180 orphans the AIDS the people of Esitjeni .
Was of them attend to the school secondary .
Por 15 or 20 EUR the month can to a child .
This contribution will the plate of the school , the uniform and you will a food a day in the Gogo Center .
Imbongi means in &quot; of stories &quot; or &quot; &quot; .
In this room nobody know about with fluidity this language , but I know .
Since ago ten years this chorus trying songs in this anymore foreign language that in times by to their place of origin : the southern of Africa .
To 8.733 kilometres of distance in line straight since Druckmaschinen , in the deliver the UK of Swaziland , there a people called Esitjeni that on of the voices of this chorus German .
The forty cent is infected
Approximately 2.000 live people there , some still in simpler they of fast and mouth , a great part of them are children .
More of 300 already not have parents because have succumbed the AIDS .
Esitjeni is a small example of what that affects to Swaziland : the rate of infection of AIDS more high and the hopes of life more in of all the world , according UNICEF .
The population is not with good eyes the circumcision , a practice that according has shown reduces to the half the risk of infection .
More the 40 % of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carrying the virus of the line , and die with something more of thirty years has become in something her .
For a journey whole to Africa in the spring of 2005 the chorus found this population , but what that were on all were many children in the streets that which not only of the protection of their parents , but of what main : food , clothes and training .
Sin title school , the for in a country poor are more that COP .
In a principle was only the particular compromise of a few what that was possible a child outside the school and of a food a day . all a few EUR .
Sin however , a year after the chorus Atatürk the partnership &quot; Voices at Africa &quot; that since then has occupied of the orphans the AIDS in Esitjeni .
Facts on the infections of sexual transmission
What are the main diseases of sexual transmission ?
Between the incidence of origin are the syphilis , the as and the .
The incidence of origin more arise are the AIDS , the virus the papilloma human , the mutilation or the hepatitis .
The and the are between the incidence airborne parasites .
What are the main groups of affected ?
The syphilis and the are with more often in men that are sexual relations with other men .
The Institute Robert Koch part of the basis of that least four of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in a sexual contact between men .
In the case of the adults the diseases of sexual transmission more arise are the infections as , , the virus the papilloma human , the ( ) and the .
The infection the HIV between the adults the country is relatively small ; not however , approximately the 20 % of the new infections HIV are in this group .
Between the young , the infections as are a more arise that in other groups of population .
According European surveys , three quarters of all the infections affect to young of between 15 and 25 years .
In our country , the virus the papilloma human also adds to the diseases more arise between the young .
How has out the number of infections ?
Not all the diseases of sexual transmission are subject to statement compulsory .
According the Institute Robert Koch , the number of infections syphilis has doubled their figure of 1.697 cases in 2001 to 3.698 cases in 2011 .
The number of new infections HIV in a trend downward since 2007 .
In 2011 registered approximately 2.700 cases .
Se is of a tenth part least that in the previous year .
What symptoms show that is of a disease ?
The infectious diseases can to in the area mutilation , bother the , flow , pain , so as or .
To often not cause pain not their other symptoms and that we not .
How can one protect ?
The condoms can reduce the risk of infection , but not offered protection the hundred hundred .
Some players wildfire of diseases of sexual transmission also can be to through of infections and physical contact .
Por this reason , the experts proposed must regularly to examinations doctors , on all if time with often of sexual couple .
If diagnosed of way early , the majority of the incidence can cured and is possible avoid any result mention .
To through of institutionalised , donations and , last but not this least important , of the refunded that price the chorus their actions in whole Germany , they to custom quite money .
&quot; in total we sent already a 200.000 EUR to Esitjeni &quot; , out proud Annette Lennartz , President of the partnership .
In the own people Zodwa gugu a woman safe of same and with on of leadership administers the money sent since Germany .
Se taken of that orphans are a good it , example with a of the grandmothers .
The &quot; &quot; , as shape to the women over in , are the pillars the people .
Some of them have to 14 orphans to their office , them offered a homeless where live and are of that children pressuring to the school all the days it and overalls with their uniform .
The not have to nobody are under the protection of Khanyisile , a woman accounts the as that two that are of cooking all the days for more of 200 hungry children , is a wage of the partnership .
Also , &quot; Voices of Africa &quot; has since in a school of remnant , has built two and , in collaboration with the organisation health US PSI , has achieved that many of the inhabitants the people have subject to a test of HIV .
This is not obvious something , since that , to despite of what patent that is this disease in all the country , is not about openly of she .
A King with 14 wives
&quot; the AIDS is a taboo no &quot; , says Annette Lennartz , &quot; because has that see with the acceptance &quot; .
Something strange in a country in the King has officially 14 wives .
The last no the Africa black , the King Mswati III , is known their lifestyle of life and full of tripping .
Poligamia in place of democracy .
This way of life not found officially is in great responsible part of the spread so fast that has experienced the virus the HIV in the last decades .
But also must to the countless that only the country of a on to another and that what have beyond where will .
According Annette Lennartz , &quot; in any corner can to condoms free , but these hardly use .
Is other culture , here only accepted the contact fur against fur &quot; .
For promote the cultural exchange , the chorus Imbongi travel every two or three years the southern of Africa songs that speak of gloom , spirit , hope and confidence in the race black , songs that many in the extreme more southern the continent African still reminiscent of the time the Apartheid .
A full bus of white that volumes songs in a language of black ; therefore recognition not only it for an excellent environment and very joy , but that also has achieved a couple of tears to some that another Bronze border .
The journey them has always to Esitjeni , where the singers their to the children .
To despite of that small population hardly is in the maps , in the valley the river Ezulweni is very known .
&quot; Acércate to Esitjeni , there which the light &quot; , says the people the place .
And after go the 8.733 kilometres in line straight of back to Druckmaschinen to the rooms of trial of the street Bergheimer teem of singers pointing the step , one account of that also is possible see their light since there .
Messenger : the NASA which ice in mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence of the existence of ice in mercury .
Probably the layer of ice have a thick of to 20 metres .
The NASA , the agency Space American , has has evidence of the existence of ice in mercury .
To despite of be the planet more have the sun , there also there water , such and as from of three studies published the Thursday in the magazine specialised &quot; Meat &quot; .
The probe Messenger would found evidence of that in the area the planet that is on to the shadow has have a layer of ice .
Seems that has the least 30 centimetres and probably even to 20 metres of thick .
The water from possesses of or , with great likelihood , of that in their day collisions against mercury .
Nobody linked the headlines of ice with the possibility of that there life in the planet , says the scientists head of the probe Messenger , are Solomon .
The temperature in mercury can achieve to 426 degrees degree .

Our window the universe : the more important
Seems that telescope was Zuse Hans Lipperhey in 1608 , before of that Galileo Galilei what green a year after for it the stars .
Since then , the mirrors of the not has unemployed of grow and the images that we offered have every time more depth .
For 30 years , specifically of 1947 to 1975 , the telescope Hale it in the Centre Palomar close of St Garcia was the more large the world .
Their mirror , in the image , had a distance of five metres .
In Arizona , US . parts . , comments the Families Binocular Telescope .
This allows it the manage to through of two mirrors , every one with a distance of 8.4 metres .
The internal the great telescope Canary it in the island of the Palma is huge - only the mirror has a distance of 10.4 metres .
The mirror the Southern Southern Families Telescope in Africa is for save costs .
Despite to this , high a distance of approximately eleven metres .
The these of this construction more economic is that telescope has an angle of raising make , what that their mobility is limited .
The telescope Hobby-Eberly in Minnesota also has an angle of raising make .
Their is their huge capacity for up light .
To despite of have with a distance of mirror comparison more small , this capacity is sixties to the of the of mirror more large the world .
With aid the telescope of Arecibo ( port Puerto ) the researchers can explore the universe in search of signals of life .
The telescope has a distance of 305 metres .
In the &quot; for of intelligence Extraterrestre &quot; ( SETI their driver in English ) can help any person that legally a computer , bringing capacity of prosecution .

Here comments the Very Families Telescope , a telescope that ago honour to their name .
With a total of four mirrors , this telescope also can the spectrum a .
The also suggestions the of E-ELT European ( Extremely Families Telescope or European telescope extremely large ) .
Their mirror maintenance will 42 metres and will up a total of 1.000 elements .
To 2018 not expected power take images .
To 2007 the two Keck located in the volcano of Mauna Kea were who the more large the world .
These have with two mirrors , every one of them with a distance of 10 metres .
The Keck are part the Centre Mauna Kea , that with to them the sky with the aid the telescope Subaru and the IRTTF .
In Mauna Kea is to build a new telescope of enormous scale and with a distance of mirror of thirty metres .
This is an image of how would .
Sin however , the information more important the manage we a of the hand the telescope Space Hubble .
Since the 24 of April of 1990 are images of worlds distant .
Since March of 2009 the telescope Space Kepler search planets , mainly those that are liveable .
The 2 of February of 2011 the NASA announced that since the beginning of their mission had localised 1.235 candidates to planets .
In the image are the last preparations very the launching the telescope Space Kepler .
The telescope James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) not launched the space to board of a had Ariane 5 to 2018 .
The mirror maintenance of this telescope Space has a distance of 6.5 metres .
A of the duties of this telescope will to the light of the first stars and Star charity after the bang bang .
The researchers proceed of the basis of that in the side southern of mercury also there ice .
Sin however , not there evidence legally , since that probe Messenger this in about the planet in an about a more their the side North .
Since ago decades the measurements of radar invite to the existence of ice in mercury .
Thank to the probe Messenger ( 2004 ) , the first that earth in about to mercury , now the scientists have the certainty of that is so .
Drinking butter to on and live 168 years

The way the region mountainous of Talysh could altogether of with and romantic .
The is with great hell to through of the road that is the on of tribes , rivers of great wealth and of the simpler houses of the local farmers .
All is green and steak , one could even think that is in the jungle black .
Sin however , we in the area more southern of Azerbaijan ; since here the border with Iran is to so only a kilometres .
Here live the &quot; &quot; , a people the not know a , from of that dominated perfectly the intolerantly and the and that are very dying .
Our destination end is Lerik .
This small city defeating of an architecture perhaps too sewn in the was Soviet and that not seems dovetailed the all in a landscape so folklore .
The European tourists hardly they to this place , already that way since the capital of Azerbaijan , Baku , is too heavy .
For go the 323 kilometres that separate both numbers urban , need eight hours because the road is of a only sense .
The astonishing wealth of the degree the country thank the oil the sea Caspian still not has come to this region .
Sin however , Pilata Fatulayeva ( 48 ) is convinced of that Lerik has what that there that have for become in a tourist tourist .
&quot; Baku was famous in May with reason of the since the festival of Song and the next year we the festival of the people more elderly the world &quot; , out Fatulayeva .
Se is of the there the Museum of the longevity , perhaps the only that there in the world .
Here is detailed the life of eight dozens of the place that have have the 100 years of age . Fatulayeva out an image in white and black .
This is my grandfather , that lived 120 years .
A son own died to the age of 136 years
Sin however , the star a Museum is the sheep of sheep Müslümov , that seems have through 168 years .
Not however , not there no starting of birth that what .
And if we in account that man of greater age detailed lived 122 years , seems that age of Müslümov is quite suspect .
&quot; born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973 &quot; , we Fatulayeva .
The man was includes in three times and had 23 children . the appear still had time of conceive a daughter more to the age of 136 years .
Se has wrong then Müslümov in their age in a couple of decades ?
Sin however , Rembrandt Scholz , in the Institute charisma Planck of Rostock , also has heard about of the elderly age of this head of Asia Central .
&quot; in some regions of China , Japan or in the valley of Hunza in Pakistan also live people of age very elderly &quot; , says Scholz , &quot; even in Sardinia there many men over &quot; .
Because to the lack of documents , is impossible to scientific evidence about of the age ; very when not there no registration civil .
All the days in of butter
Is a fact that , of way surprisingly often , the inhabitants of the region on in about to Lerik usually achieve an age custodianship .
In the today there 20 people that over the 100 years of age .
Por what live here , in the southern , many people of age elderly ?
The on purposes Farid Mugimzadeh it that is of the special genes of the .
The there the Museum , the Sra. Fatulayeva , believes in change that cause lies in the food .
Sin however , since a point of nutritional view , not seems logical that precisely the food rich in lowcalorie of the , that meat , the bread and on all the products dairy and many of the which , also , they daily a glass of butter , be so healthy .
Or perhaps be the way of natural life the in to the young people ? in Cengemiran , a small settlement not far of the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva .
To their 97 years is relatively young for what that these relocate .
Mirzayeva , that says have 143 descendants , lives in a simple home of typical wood of whole the region the Caucasus .
Ages in the soil , at of way unstinting a huge of butter .
Eight people live under a homeless , between them one of the children and a daughter of Mirzayeva , both became in grandparents ago time .
Also of a on to another two small children .
In the kitchen prepare teaspoons for the invited , a teaspoons that serve in a classic with way .
The European of Mirzayeva are white and are perfectly premises and under the headscarf behind two we of hair yellow dark that their son we which proud .
Always I I laundering the hair with milk , that never I has fallen and has had their colour .
&quot; not I used never a cosmetic &quot; , says Mirzayeva .
The pension is enough for live
Of always has – only what that was in their own farm : canned , potatoes and peas .
In whole my life not I gone never to to the buying to a supermarket .
Then we about of their husband , that was in the army .
What worst was the time of to the second war World .
Sin however , all the to their put when the &quot; wanted father &quot; , Heydar Aliyew , took the control of the situation .
This kind of propaganda sounds rare in their of a woman greater .
Sin however , in Azerbaijan the seems that federalist to the on mistreated of the nation , that at their country as a dictator , not known limits .
This remained in the power to 2003 , time in the gave the witnessed to their son Ilham .
The least the people over of Azerbaijan not know what that is the poverty .
Mirzayeva price 230 ( approximately the same amount in EUR ) in concept of pension monthly , an amount with the can live well taking in account the situation here .
And perhaps the son of Mirzayeva have reason : &quot; in our culture the over are very respected &quot; .
Live in a great family , are , receive all the necessary care and are happy .
As if this not outside reason enough for in with many life years ...
In the constitution lack the expression &quot; rights human &quot;
The revolution has their the Cairo .
Demonstrations that vying between in the Cairo are of clear the grossly division in the is desperately the country .
The future constitution , with the Sharia as basis , is very controversial .
The President Egyptian not PR in grand .
&quot; we overcome the transition .
And that happen is my responsibility , to the people and to God &quot; , said in the television public .
Their speech was at to all the people , on all to the Coptic Christians , the Liberals , the Muslims go and the secular .
All them , ragamuffin no to now in a confused opposition , have fear .
Fear of a theocracy to on the Nile the grace of the powerful Community Muslim .
Such and as it Mohammed Mursi , almost asking forgiveness , has had that withdrawn of temporary way the powers the Court Constitutional and further the you &quot; for power save the revolution &quot; .
Sin however , not the Egyptians not the world whole know very well what that draughtsman of 61 years with a title of PhD orientates the University the southern of California to save really .
To deprived of their power to the judiciary ?
Of fact , the 234 articles , whose adoption has been forced a House assembly states 100 Member corresponding Islamists in a meeting quality of 15 hours of a , are truly worrying .
As in previous constitutions , in the draft also says that for on in the &quot; principles the right Islamic &quot; .
Sin however , what means that of &quot; principles &quot; ?
This was and still be open to the interpretation and seems that Islamists will to take this vague he , so as the for of legal manoeuvre that has honour , for impose an interpretation more strict of the Sharia .
This is the least what that suggests a new Article added : in all the issues relating to the Sharia is compulsory put to the University Al-Ashar , the institution Islamic more important the country with a great power in all the Uighurs .
Not has what be so , but this can mean that clergy monitored the legislation , something that - of fact - would as result the ’ of the judiciary .
Great part the draft of the constitution is open to the interpretation
What that also is problem is that to keep the military jurisdiction .
For the dictatorship of Mubarak these courts which for as a hard repression on the opposition .
After the with the dictator to 11.000 civilians who as in military prisons .
Such and as for the draft , the state has of protect &quot; the real essence of the family Egyptian &quot; and &quot; promote their moral and their values &quot; .
Se is of a he so imprecise in legal terms that with the aid of this Article the institutions state could even control the content of the understandable and the literature .
About clear is not of other thing that of censure .
Por true that no Article for of way explicitly the equality between men and women .
In change another prohibits offend or punished the Prophet Mohammed and to their travelling .
Sin however , is not clear what is an offend and how has of be sanctioned .
As of doubtful is the he that prohibits the &quot; offend to the people &quot;
Is enough a as the President or a joke on a ?
Question of interpretation , as many other things in the draft that has been tabled to Mursi for their signing and that according , their words , &quot; very soon &quot; will tabled to the Egyptians for be subject to referendum .
&quot; the revolution has again &quot;
Ago weeks that opposition is closing queues with to the superiority of the Islamists .
Ten billion met people in a unusual harmony in the later the Friday in the place Square the Cario and to fail the Minutes before of that can into in force .
&quot; the revolution has their and end defeating &quot; , says Hamdin Sabbahi , that taken the third place in the lists to the presidential elections .
The Peace of the peace and the international Agency of energy Atomic , supporting El-Baradei , declared that draft of the constitution should be &quot; in the dustbin of the waste of the history &quot; .
To through of Twitter was to the followers of Mursi of to lead a &quot; coup of state against the democracy &quot; .
&quot; when called the referendum reflect to their Palacio and what &quot; , says the Maracaibo Jasser Akbar .
&quot; still we not .ired , the blood of our Muslim still not has been &quot; , from in the media Egyptians the political Maracaibo Chaled Ali .
And several judges announced that not wanted monitor the referendum , what that not considered valid .
&quot; the Koran is our constitution &quot;
Por their part , the Community Muslim well organised was a call for so a ; if are not in the place Square , but after a sentence the another on the Nile , to the University of the Cairo .
Many women covered with an entering and supporters of the were part in the same the out of : &quot; the people requires the implementation of the law level &quot; .
Demanded to Mursi &quot; must the country &quot; , the same time that : &quot; the Koran is our constitution &quot; .
A fight the sovereignty of the symbolic place Square , where started all , would caused a similar situation to the of a war civil .
Is clear that supporters of Mursi not wanted avail to that something so and .
The Muslim Muslims said that therefore the who the draft of the constitution as the supporters the same would expressed their high views and clear .
Now would come the time of to that people bore in the ballot what direction should to the country .
In this sense , seems that draft of the Islamists has transaction the majority .
&quot; the expression &apos; rights human &apos; not even is &quot;
Were Mazen Saeda is furious with this process Constitutional forced that in reality should have disburse to February and have including to all the social forces .
This lawyer of 48 years specialises in rights human and President of the organisation Egyptian of human rights ( EOHR ) for to the Muslim Muslims when who held in prison or had that to with to a trial for the dictatorship of Mubarak .
Not because their ideology , but because for he the rights human are indivisible .
Por this reason was beat , condemned and imprisoned .
&quot; and now the expression human &apos; not even is in the new constitution &quot; , regrets in a conversation with the newspaper &quot; Welt Am am &quot; .
The enlargement of the powers of Mursi to the three powers the state was that lawyer resign .
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules the at democratic and will to Egypt to a new dictatorship .
&quot; in place of strengthen the society civil , what that has fact the President is &quot; , regrets Saeda .
Sin however , the democracy not can work the organisations of the society civil .
Saeda feel abandoned , also the international Community , the which is the ideological fight that is taking place to on the Nile with a of curious and tension .
This could them in their against .
A in the place Square on : &quot; you a monster that not control &quot; .

Mexico : eight Peña grandson faces to a hard beginning
While the President incoming of Mexico , eight Peña grandson , for for take possession of their office , the correspondent of the BBC , Will Bellamy , analysing the challenges to the facing the new President and the different expectations of their population .
The traffic in city of Mexico is especially bad currently .
In a city that , in the best circumstances , already is of , has installed since the Monday an encirclement of steel that short several of the roads main that have to the city and that is causing a huge chaos in the roads .
The aim , not however , not was prevent that workers so to to their place of work , but avoid that demonstrators so to the Parliament .
The Saturday , the new President of Mexico , eight Peña grandson , will the bandwidth presidential and will the management of the nation .
Se faces to a task difficult .
Mexico has gone obtaining good results economic for the government outgoing of Felipe Calderón , but the country is undeclared in a war against the has claimed already a 60.000 lives in six years .
&quot; my government has the great compromise with the people Mexican of reduce the violence &quot; , he the Sr. Peña grandson to principles of this week the President of States United , Barack Obama , in the clearance shenanigans .
&quot; i to propose a new strategy of security that we will achieve that aim &quot; .
Before of with the President of the EE.UU. , the experience policy prior the Sr. Peña was as Governor of their state home , the of Mexico .
A state very populated and with a quickly growth , that are the capital ; the views on the new leader are divided in this territory in the he held ! .
A man honest
In the city of valley the bravo , example , you reminds with will .
Their residents you some the merit the growth the tourism in the place and of the construction of infrastructure .
For to to the city can drive a of the new roads the Sr. Peña grandson , what that is a huge improvement compared with the roads and pictures of bumpy that were .
Also can see Rachinel with their name in the entry of a modern and of an impressive exponential Museum on the change climate .
&quot; we in that he successful to a change real and lasting &quot; , says their friend and ally political Mor Olvera irreplaceable , Member the party the Sr. Peña grandson , the PRI .
&quot; particularly , in what that as to security and economy , we the interesting and real change that our country therefore needs &quot; .
After a period uninterrupted of 81 years in the power , the PRI was Vicente Fox in the year 2000 .
The Member Olvera accepts that , after 12 years outside the Palacio presidential of the Pinos , within the party there many expectations regard to eight Peña grandson .
This also the rating that opposition ago of lack of essence the new President .
&quot; is a man very honest , very committed and with an excellent vision the country .
Is a fantastic man of state and , above of all , is a person that know listen . &quot;
Sin however , the another on the state that is not the impression that has very people on their former Governor .
In Nezahualcoyotl , known also as city Neza , the contrast with the streets of valley the bravo not could be greater .
Escondida under stretches of high Motorway is , in many ways , a suburb of the own city of Mexico .
And the problems the Yevgenyevka are also hard and urban .
To principles of this year asked the intervention of the military for that commit in the fight against the gangs of drugs that operating in the areas and the violence against the women is especially serious .
In a strong , on with to a waste of waste , have longer ruins in so only the two last years the bodies of dozens of women murdered .
More of 1.000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while the Sr. Peña grandson was the Governor , a rate a more higher that of city Juárez , unfortunately famous their violence and a place that is synonymous of murder of women innocent .
The critical the Sr. Peña grandson say , in the better of the cases , that not it address the problem the perpetrators while was in the office .
The more critical accusing to their administration of to the view blind .
In a home of concrete , typical the area , Irinea Buendía has that to efforts for contain the tears while I shows photographs of their daughter , Mariana order .
According the version official of the facts , Mariana suicide in 2010 .
Sin however , their family believes that their couple the killed .
&quot; when i to their home , seemed as if you would rolls the body &quot; , reminds the madam Buendía .
&quot; had signs of that had been severe and the rigour already had appeared &quot; .
While their mother tracing the history , a was of Mariana is since the walls , with to a cross in the reads a only word : justice .
Sin however , that is exactly what that family says that you has denied .
&quot; the authorities the state I have Treaty as if outside an old , a .
What that want is that one simply accept what that them say and that street &quot; .
&quot; but that not can be so when have there many irregularities and so negligence &quot; , says .
The bandwidth presidential that President Peña grandson will the Saturday will accompanied of a huge responsibility .
Tens of thousands of families have seen affected crimes violent in Mexico for the last six years and the new President has promised them priority for their mandate .
&quot; hope that be the same kind of President that was when was Governor &quot; , says the Member the PRI Olvera in valley the bravo .
Sin however , that is exactly what that families of the victims of city Neza more fear .

Meade , Maryland , the tax commander honourable Ashden said that records of the visits week of official of the unit that Manning received for nine months of detention in Quantico , prominent , not show no concession on the treatment that received .
The interrogation , that was to out for a view so to as of the request of the defence of that draftsman the case given that their indefinite had been hard and that already had course enough punishment , came a day after of that Manning would hired that had thought in lives while was arrested .

More later , WikiLeaks published the material in Internet .
Wikileaks not has confirmed never that Manning outside the source of information .

The official would done questions to Manning and note their answers .
When the honourable Friday asked on the forms , Manning Interinstitutional that had described the treatment that you by the as &quot; excellent &quot; and the treatment received in the installations in general as &quot; very professional &quot; .
The forms not show no concession of bad abuse , to despite of that official filed to Manning directly on the treatment that received , said honourable .
Manning replied that had expressed their concern on some issues and that official that you travels had about of these problems and you had signalled that was , but that them not was i of these issues in the registration .
&quot; go &apos; ozone &apos; ( after of have about of the problems ) but this not means necessarily that I not would mentioned no problem &quot; , said Manning .
The judge , Colonel the army Denise Lind , also asked to Manning what not had denounced the treatment that received for the meeting that had place in January of 2011 with a Council responsibility of at the intentions of suicide that had expressed in a form months before .
Manning replied that their intention for that meeting was the of obtain the reduction the regime of &quot; prevention of injury &quot; under the which was .
The military said that you had since under that been regime , that is a degree below the of possible surveillance suicide , for ensure their protection and the security of other people .
&quot; wanted that state greater pointless that I was well and ( wanted ) to of be under prevention of injury ... for power enjoy of what that , since my point of view , is a better quality of life &quot; , said Manning .

Said that fact of that not you allowed know what that you was happening or what that was in the foreign world was very distressing .
&quot; my world reduced so only the camp Arafjon , to that reported &quot; , he Manning the Thursday .
&quot; i that was to die in that reported &quot; .
Manning said a time made to Quantico , was the majority of the days in a small cell , the least for 21 hours and to often for 23 hours , company .

The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy , to of illegal way the publication of information in Internet , apparent of information of the national defence and theft of property or public records .
If is declared guilty of all the charges , could face to chain life .
My crisis of identity mexicano-estadounidense
Says that many were forced to leave Mexico because to the lack of opportunities
The Mexican tend to criticise to the were ; says that reminiscent to the Mexican of those times difficult
Navarrette observing that mexicano-estadounidenses are trapped between two worlds .
In a recent journey to city of Mexico , hardly had down the on and come to the area of has of immigration and already was completely confusing .
A notices did the way towards two on : a for &quot; Mexican &quot; and other for &quot; foreign &quot; .
I was there a seconds be sure towards where should go .
The have grown in California Central , for whole my life I have called &quot; Mexican &quot; .
Se is of ethnic , the same way in that my friends of Boston are to ourselves as &quot; Irish &quot; or my friends of new York as to ourselves &quot; Italian &quot; .
More later I decided &quot; mexicano-estadounidense &quot; .
But this was Mexico .
And , in the homeland of my grandfather , the or the paragraphs not were necessary .
Simply was US .
I Spanish . what enough well as for for an interview in this language .
But not have the level of vocabulary of an and not can of my accent American .
So that I my passport US and I I in the EU of foreign .
Thought in at time of this week in the President elected of Mexico , eight Peña grandson , visited the home White for meet with the President Obama .
In the agenda the day , as always that meet the leaders of these two countries , withdrew : immigration , drugs and trade .
Peña grandson was look about also the growth of the economy Mexican , a of the reasons the in these at is so likely a Mexican be in Mexico as that unwanted to go to the States United .
To partner with States United and Canada and create in America a bloc trade the lifestyle of the Union European .
Also , Peña grandson promised to fighting against the which of the drugs in Mexico , although not was details .
For Mexico , the relationship with the States United is difficult and is full of grudge .
Probably the majority of Americans never remember of that in 1848 the States United invaded Mexico and his to their leaders to yield the half of their territory to is of at .
But for the Mexican , that think in centuries , not in minutes , the elements that what reminiscent are all parties .
So that , in the time in an official of the States United says any thing that such the more minimum criticism to Mexico , to hear complaints , therefore in the press as between the elite Mexican , on how the Americans are the sovereignty of their neighbours .
And the children of Moctezuma are in ordinary of war .
And still so , for Mexico , the relationship that really is all a challenge is the have with the more of 35 million of mexicano-estadounidenses that live in the States United .
We of grudge ?
There a .
In Mexico there winners and losers , people for the country provided opportunities and other for the is not so .
The only reason the there many people of Hungarians Mexican living in cities as the Angeles , the Vegas , as , Denver or St for is that , in some point of our tree , there a person , can that father or the mother or one of the grandparents , to the you closed the door of the opportunities in Mexico and had that leave towards the North .
And the majority of the sometimes that person fit in a particular profile : fur whites , a level of studies under , from of a poor people , etc.
Us we their see and them we loyal .
To Mexico not .
And , to despite of that perhaps we living now the dream American , the have gone to good schools and have had good jobs , we not .ose never of view that what that we living is the dream American , and not the Mexican .
Is possible that to sometimes our identity is not clear , but our bay that what is .
Is for the States United .
Also , we aware of that to many of the Mexican lot to the elite of the class leader not them .
The sense is mutual .
We are as a reminder of a defeat humiliating and we who above the card as if about of a category than that is not what enough Mexican .
Our Spanish never will what enough good and our links with Mexico never will what enough strong .
To their way of see , our existence is synonymous of failure .
If our families not would failed in Mexico , not would gone .
And now we not .e trapped after this significant of wrap , living well in the States United but , still so , as souls .
My woman , that born in Guadalajara and wine legally to the States United when was a girl , I reminds that there this between the Mexican and the mexicano-estadounidenses because the first know with more strength who are and to the seconds this them bother .
Although is citizens of the States United , she as part of the two countries .
While therefore , many mexicano-estadounidenses that know feel that not are part of none of the two .
We love listen the group Mexican the Tigers the North , but also to Bruce Springsteen .
You what better of every country , but not with solid to none of them .
In Mexico we are as Americans .
And in the States United we as Mexican .
Now , for more still more the things , what that I I have for my journey , some leaders Mexican and some intellectuals want again to connecting with the diaspora .
Want that mexicano-estadounidenses work as &quot; ambassadors &quot; of Mexico makeshift , been their interests in the States United .
Diríamos to our colleagues Americans what fantastic that is visiting that country and to the leaders political for that their links with Mexico .
Sí , clear ...
That is not to to .
There too grudge .
And , with the inequality of wages , the corruption rampant and the violence drugs , many of us we not .o insurance of that be a fantastic country .
I fear that you Sötét to be alone with this idea , friends .
Is fair .
If some Mexican still not are prepared for pardon to the States United the way in the were to Mexico ago a century and a , then have that accept the fact of that some mexicano-estadounidenses still are begrudgers how was to their family ago great least time .
Hmmm .
Perhaps us more &quot; Mexican &quot; of what that i .
This battles , new East a
The high the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas well could be a basis likely little for the peace
Will have some day a peace lasting between Arab and Jews in East a ?
Another bloodletting of blood that seems indicate that any hope is in vain .
In a of the so and arise further on who began first , countless of buildings have been lower to rubble ; more of 140 Palestinians , the majority of them civilians , and six Israelis have been killed and , first time , rockets from of Gaza have fallen close of Tel Tel , the scorning of Israel , and the city Holy of Jerusalem .
But , to despite of that Israelis and the Palestinians seem be sections in their former conflict , all as them are in East an is changing .
The spring Arab what has longer all fact dirty them whether or not , Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional mighty .
Perhaps this do that their fight be still more bloody that before .
Sin however , there reasons for think that their lethal situation of point died could .
A war that not lose not earns
To first view , the optimism seems currently very difficult of justify .
Even if in the high the ceasefire agreed the 21 of November , the clashes of this week have reinforced to the hawks of both sides .
The leaders of Hamas , the movement Islamist that has centre Gaza since 2007 , have have forced to the Israelis to from , to despite of that Gaza has received a good him .
And to despite of have killed to some of their leaders and trouble to pressure to the 1.7 million of inhabitants of Gaza in one of the they more squalid and bound the planet , Israel not has been end with Hamas .
Of fact , Hamas is gaining ground in Bank , the other part of Palestine currently ruled their implacable rival of Fatah , the Palestine more moderate .
Also , the leaders of Hamas could to to the conclusion of that time is to their favour .
Given that Islamists have gone gaining influence all the world Arab , Hamas has fact richest and powerful .
Turkey , a regional power that before had been the ally Muslim more have to Israel , has espoused the cause of Hamas . also what has fact Qatar , one of the States more rich and dynamic the Gulf .
The Member of Hamas say that average order Islamist is crusade Israel , since the Lebanon the North , where dominates the partido-milicia Hizbulá , happening Syria , where the rebels of a trend every time more Islamist could bring to Bashar by , to to to Jordan , where the allies of Hamas are threatening the King .
On all in the with southern of Israel , the growth of the Muslim Muslims targeted the President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt , with difference the more populated and fundamental of the countries Arab , has changed the balance of the region .
Hosni Mubarak , the guarding that period in Egypt for 30 years to their fall in 2011 , not had too time for Hamas .
In change , the Muslim Muslims are cousins Muslim of Hamas and their leaders on more of the opinion popular .
In future diplomatic actions , is possible that Hamas could as leading the not can from , not even Israel and the States United .
While therefore , the arrived hard of Israel sorry the conclusion opposite .
In what that as the military question , have since to Hamas in their website .
The system missiles Cúpula of iron of Israel has shown their effectively and many of the rockets of Hamas have been destroyed .
The Israelis more so ... for some time .
In as to the diplomacy , States United shows more firm that never ; many European countries also to Hamas of have on the last wave of violence .
To all , Israel has been . especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu , a first Minister that has ignored this process of peace .
Although the rockets fired since Gaza have over with the life of a 30 Israelis since 2004 , Israel not has had many terrorists suicide , in part thank to the barrier that Bank , the main part of a territory aspiring to become in state of Palestine , and it the settlements Jews that are increasing to despite of that , according the international legislation , are illegal .
The Sr. Netanyahu , whose party fighters has UK to a group of a line still more hard by Avigdor Lieberman in the period become to the elections the 22 of January , is in a good position .
Por what to these Palestinians a state own ?
If really in Bank , not rockets such and as have fact their compatriots in Gaza ?
Is better ! after that Wall and them a good coup if rose the head .
Perhaps will the arrived hard , although the spring Arab could tamper their are .
Although the Islamists that take the power in Egypt and in other websites not have too hold to Israel , their priority will address the internal difficulties .
The budget of defence of Israel is greater that of their four neighbours Arab together .
To a war with the superpower of the area hardly will to the new governments Arab to improve their economies .
That May Sr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama for to the high the ceasefire is a good well and could usher the beginning of something .
Also the Israelis should think to long term .
With the rest the world Arab inventive more democratic , deprived to the Palestinians of their right to the am is create a volcano a day in the territories occupied Israel , of the same way that constable week a bus in Tel Tel .
The repression already is destroying the democracy in the state Jewish and the demography worse the situation to measure that is the population Arab .
The missions against Gaza every two or three years for reject to Hamas they a diplomatic toll every time greater .
Both sides need a right of people which the conflict .
The solution still being the sensible people of both sides , the majority the foreign world and this newspaper : two States and the afford of territory part of Israel reasons of security .
The hope , small to short term , is that high the ceasefire given a little more of momentum to the people which that are fighting this cause .
Egypt , that must start to to curb to the entry of weapons in Gaza , with with Turkey and Qatar , is in a situation unprecedented for to to Hamas of that accept the idea of a state Jewish based in the borders of 1967 , with exchanges of land and a Jerusalem shared .
The Arab spokesmen the issue also should pressure to Hamas and Fatah for that join .
That help more to the creation of a state Palestinian that imminent attempt of obtain a category of virtual state in the UN .
The Sr. Obama also has an important role in what that as to to to to Israel to the table of negotiating .
For their first mandate it their own plan for the peace .
Of new in the home White , seems as of reluctant to unique their attention .
This attitude is a deplorable vision of future .
A East a stable is of vital interest for the States United .
This means an agreement of peace between Israel and Palestine .
The law of packaged nitrofurans of tobacco will in force in Australia
Warnings on the risks of smoking and parties the body with diseases on packets of a microphone colour green , that are the same for all the trademark of tobacco
The law – in on of tobacco and packaged nitrofurans , Europe in the world , will in force and replacing the which and the colours of the trademark a fobbed of a microphone green olive , an appalling images of parties the body with diseases and representations of children and babies people be children of parents smokers .
To exception of the various images and warnings health , the only difference between the packets , can since the Saturday , are the names of the trademark , all them printed in a kind of small source .
Se is the regime more narrower the world applied the packaged of tobacco .
The government Federal of Australia says that aim is could to the young of smoking by the elimination of the broad that do that habit have .
Responding in studies that shown that if a person not has started to smoking before of the 26 years , there a 99 % of for of that never what do .
&quot; Se can see that children , even since very early age , understand the message that company tobacco is trying sell to through of their mark &quot; , said the Minister of health Federal , Tanya Plibersek , quote studies that aggressive , example , how the girls the logo of a crown with the idea of be a who .
To despite of that Australia account with a of the rates of smokers more in the world and that these changes not will too to the profits of the multinationals , other countries are at take similar measures .
The industry tobacco has a huge pressure in against of the law .
The companies producers said that law enterprise the market black of tobacco , in the cigarette would more cheaper and more accessible .
&quot; the legislation comply serious consequences do &quot; , said Ayr McIntyre , of the British American Tobacco , in Australia .
Will the amount of tobacco that bring the counterfeiters of China and Indonesia for marketplace in the streets of Australia .
Other people say that their business has benefited after the adoption of the law .
Sandra has , of Zico Import Pty co , a small company family , said that demand of and covered of implants for loopholes the unpleasant images of the packets had ring almost since zero ago two months , when the British American Tobacco , Britain &apos; at imperial Tobacco , Philip Morris and also Tobacco lost a weakening to the law in the Court Supreme of Australia .
The Sra. has said that Zico had sold to 6.000 units to retail establishments and that was waiting more stocks .
&quot; for us is a good business &quot; .
According the experts , the possible obstacle is the popularity of the social networks between the demographic sector the at the plan .
After a series of laws collecting that prohibit the advertising in the television and the sponsorship of sports and that on to the majority of sellers to not to the cigarette to the view , the marketing the tobacco has last to take in line .
Australia has ban the advertising in Internet to companies and pages website local , but not can constrain in foreign pages .
&quot; if tobacco and so only you is this small window for promote your products , the space in line is the place more convincing in the be &quot; , said Becky Freeman , it of public health of the University of Sydney .
Freeman observed an increase of packet on trademark from of &quot; citizens of to ordinary &quot; premises in pages website of social networks as YouTube , Twitter and Facebook .
Is ask if is so only of a private citizen to who really you crazy the cigarettes Marlboro and has taken the trouble of to a video or if any company of marketing is behind of all this .
The British American Tobacco of Australia pressed that industry on more in what that means the new regulation that in the marketing .
The industry has come even to pay for that Ukraine , Honduras and the Republic Dominican the new rules ; these countries are saying to the organisation World the trade that is restrictive the trade unfairly , to despite of that none of these countries has a volume of significant trade with Australia .
Is likely that WTO dictate a resolution to in of 2013 .
Plibersek said that government had had discussions with other countries that are at apply similar laws in on of packaged of tobacco .
In the year 2001 Canada became in the first country that introduced the mandatory of include images in the packets .
Currently are can in more of 40 countries , between the are Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine .
In great Britain , new Zealand , Africa and India is at apply laws more tough .
In many Australia smokers show harsh .
&quot; the photographs not I affect .
Simply not them I case &quot; .
&quot; Coges the and guards the package &quot; , says Messmer the Hage while buying a package with the image of a by in the their .
&quot; sincerely , only there a reason the cease of smoking : my daughter . &quot;
James Yu , workforce the King of the Pack in the centre of Sydney , that packets uniform do that you it more complicated getting in the shelves .
&quot; normally de a time in an over ; now four &quot; , says Yu .
&quot; the government should have ban completely the tobacco and then , already is , is , over and they the shop &quot; , says while comments the hands towards down .
In a world constantly provider , is not so dull a little
For the testing the day of action of thank of this year , of way unexpectedly had that to five hours in an airport because the air in the was a problem engineering and had that wait to that would another air .
So that had great time for think in the platitude .
Not you i to lie .
Pasarse a day in an airport waiting to that it a flight is quite boring , even if you media for be Have , as books , weeklies or , ignore of the duty-free shops .
But every time there more academic and experts in development child that praising the blessings the platitude .
According them , is well that , therefore us as our children , we of time in when .
Dull forced the which to to options interesting and can that encourage the creativity .
Given that , currently , the majority of us we connected to this or to that screen , we not .he profits that provided the platitude .
So that , should accept of good mind the platitude ?
Sí .
And not .
But , already we of this more forward .
In first place , the as that very people , supposed that , now that have of more time for the leisure , the platitude would a phenomenon relatively recent .
But , such and as says Peter Toohey , professor of history Greek and Roman of the University of Calgary , in Canada , and author the book &quot; Boredom : to Lively History &quot; ( &quot; the platitude , a history encouraged &quot; ) published in 2011 Yale University reporter , is not so .
&quot; of fact , the history the platitude is very can &quot; , says .
In the walls of Pompeya there in Latin on the platitude that dating the century I d.C.
Also we ourselves how define the platitude .
&quot; the problem is that already has defined and discussed of very various ways &quot; , that John D. Eastwood , Professor of Psicología of the University of York in Ontario , Canada .
After at the research premises and raise the idea to a group of discussion have 100 people , the Professor Eastwood and their colleagues defined the platitude as the experience of &quot; desired , but not power , participate in an activity that you full &quot; .
Says that difference between the platitude and the apathy is that person not ago something but to do .
Out that with the apathy not there the wish of to something .
The experience main the platitude , says , is &quot; the at the process of attention , associated to a under state of mind and to a that of that time is slowly &quot; .
The platitude can sound turmoil be to the depression .
Sin however , the Professor Eastwood says that , although they be related , the people that are inhuman tend to see the problem as a question the environment or the world , while that people that are exceptions they that problem what have them .
To sometimes we that we boring , when what that we is in reality is that we problems for our .
In their study &quot; the Unengaged Mind : Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention &quot; , published in the edition of September of the magazine Perspectives as Psychological Meat , the Professor Eastwood and their colleagues were to an previous experiment in the participants a cut of a person that saturation the Article of a magazine .
Some groups heed in the room neighbouring a programme of television to all volume that not bore no relationship , other what heed with the volume under , of way that hardly was noticeable , while that third group not listened the audio in no time .
The group that listened the programme with the volume under was more platitude that other two groups ; them cost focus , but not were insurance of what and what the platitude .
&quot; when in a task difficult or interesting , the at of the attention can to the platitude &quot; , pressed Mark J. Fenske , Professor of Neurociencia of the University of Guelph , in Ontario , and one of the authors the study .
&quot; Por another on , when with doing something boring , as detect parts unprepared in a line of manufacture , a music that you you can help to not &quot; .
&quot; of fact , currently we that ! or to , actions that to often are as sign of platitude , can in reality help to combat , already that do that person is physically more vigilant &quot; .
&quot; the research shown that those children to the them allows ! about more and observation more information that those to the them forced to be static &quot; , says the Professor Fenske .
All we what that is dull in some time : the delay of an air , a speaker spin , a film especially uninspiring .
But some people have more trend to dull that other .
For help to , some researchers proceeded in the years 80 a &quot; at of trend the platitude &quot; .
The at includes issues as &quot; many of the things that have that to are repetitive and &quot; and &quot; there many things that I interested that not have time of do all &quot; .
Instigation Vodanovich , Professor of Psicología of the University of West Florida , says that , being these regional , the researchers have discovered that boys have more trend to dull more to often that girls , and specifically need more stipulation external and more diverse .
But , in general , the adolescents are a kind of group that boring with quite easily .
In 1991 , Reed Larson , Professor of development human and Community of the University of Illinois , it was to out an experiment in the disposal in contact with 400 adolescents and with their parents between seven and eight sometimes the day by a search .
Found that 32 cent of the adolescents said that while was in the school or doing the duties , while that 23 cent said that when not was in the school .
Por another on , the 3 cent of the parents were that .
The Professor Larson said that not was if the rates of current platitude , 21 years after , would with or lower .
But said that what that was was that &quot; the adolescence is a period in the platitude high their correctness more high &quot; , in great part because to that therefore to the children as to the adolescents not them a great control on what that want to .
So that , back to my question the principle : is good dull ?
To sometimes not what is , already that , taken the extreme , can to that we exposing to physical risks absurd , as to betting or we in the consumption of substances as method for combat , such and as shown the research .
Por another on , many scholarship and writers speak of the connection between the platitude and the creativity , according says the Professor Vodanovich , that has state at this question for more of two decades .
&quot; the platitude is the way that has the which of word that we be doing other thing &quot; , says fringes Marcus , Professor of Psicología of the University of new York .
But the which not always know what is what more appropriate .
If with boring and you that energy for play the or cooking , that you satisfy .
But if you the television , is possible that you who to short term , but not to long term .
&quot; so that , if your son is boring and you Give an iPad , is possible that already not , but not will learned to same hands or to &quot; , says the Professor Fenske .
And &quot; that capacity of applies to other situations &quot; , out .
Your son not only learns to hands only , but that learns to unchecked better in other areas .
Not i that really want i the platitude .
But not should be too critical with he .
Our aim should be , more well , the of favourable be paragraphs the rumour constant of the activities and the technologies .
The Professor Eastwood is of agreement .
&quot; to our way of see , need more , but the platitude is a wish too distressing and disturbing as for linked with something that deserves the it &quot; , says .
Out that what that people really search is a way of switch and of enjoy of a time died .
&quot; in an environment in the we constantly &quot; , says , &quot; is difficult find forms of focus our attention when the noise by &quot; .
Mistreated : book of instructions for the new law on the consumption of marijuana
Anthony Orozco , student of 19 years in a Institute Community and exalting the Asia of mistreated , faces to a process criminal something that soon will legal in all the state : the possession of a stones of marijuana and a pipe that his for .
Orozco says a day of September , he and some friends Lamar , in the plains registrars to the border of Kansas , when the stopped the police .
The police found marijuana in the car and a time after Orozco received a legal summons possession of drugs and articles related ( crimes age that threat every one fined of 100 dollars Americans ) in the you Detectives of the date the trial .
&quot; we are as to criminal &quot; , says Orozco .
And what are ?
In the weeks of uncertainty following to the vote that had place in mistreated for the legalisation of the possession of small quantities of marijuana for use hand , the answer in hundreds of causes age possession of drugs on least of the law that of the location .
Hundreds of crimes age possession of marijuana are overwritten therefore here as in the state of Washington , where adopted a similar measure .
The departments of police have longer of it charges against the over of 21 years possession to small at , that will legally a time the law has entered in force in the next weeks .
But the tax of districts more Conservatives of mistreated have committed to to forward with the open cases possession of marijuana and still are quote to people .
The same time , several cities , since the suburbs of Denver to the mountains Western , are voting for prevent that open shops of marijuana , you recently , in their communities .
&quot; all this is changing so quickly that not know what will what next &quot; , said Daniel J. Oates , head of police in Aurora , fair the of Denver .
Who are of the there in the state of Washington also are our around the issue .
And are for advice for establish a system of licences of production , manufacture , distribution and sale ; all this before of that it the date limit , the 1 of December of 2013 .
Say that , for well or for , mistreated is front of the majority of the States in as to the regulation the use of the marijuana , first with for and now for use hand .
&quot; mistreated at of a market more regulated , so that will a good on &quot; , says Mr E. Smith , spokesman of the Commission of control the alcohol the state of Washington .
But the Sr. Smith accepts that any place or system only can to suggestions on what that could work .
&quot; not there a real precedent that we as of model &quot; , says .
The law of Washington , which I-502 , will in force the 6 of December , what that is also a year for the which between two waters , already that system of licences in that state still not will , but the possession will legal .
Also , there some mechanical sensitive issues that must resolved for that period , as the way of keep a balance between the demand the state of offer a &quot; access appropriate &quot; to the marijuana authoritative and their ban of to business of cannabis in a radio than to 300 metres of schools , parks , areas of at children or centres children .
&quot; in no place will more difficult a business of cannabis for that in the areas urban , especially in the area city of Seattle &quot; , says Ben Livingston , spokesman the centre for the legal cannabis , a group of research created recently .
The 21 of November , Oates , the head of police of Aurora , sent an electronic email to their players of police in the them Detectives of that tax of the city cease of prevail judicial actions one very possession of marijuana to people over of 21 years and of that police cease of it charges against these crimes &quot; with effect immediately &quot; .
The head of police Oates said that them away of to to the regulation of the city that regulates the as of marijuana with for therapeutic and that begrudgers pursued to traffickers and sellers of drugs .
In the county of Weld , in the North of mistreated , the tax the district , Ken Buck , represents a vision more strict .
After the vote , was that their office solitary pursued the cases of possession of marijuana , mainly for pressure to the consumers and that have to receive treatment .
Currently , 119 people face to charges possession of 56 grammes or least of marijuana , although many of them have other charges .
&quot; our office has the duty of prevail judicial actions against those one that in the time in that there were crime &quot; , said the Sr. Buck in a statement .
The answer has been difficult even in places as the rural county of table , where the voters rejected the initiative on the legalisation of the marijuana .
The police of Grand Junction , the greater city the county , already not quotation to adults possession of small quantities .
Pete Hautzinger , tax the district the county , supported this decision , but also decided not underestimating none of the outstanding cases possession .
&quot; not i that is losing the time the to doing to the law to that changes &quot; , said .
To despite of that 55 cent of the voters supported the measure , never was that to the consumption of marijuana for use hand the within the government and the legal system outside to be easy .
The reactions at that arise all the state are of clear a marked ambivalence between the officials regard the great experiment using in this state .
&quot; Se is of a cultural barrier with the tax the district &quot; , says are McAllister , a lawyer of Denver that represents to the accused possession of marijuana and that is local spokesman of the national organisation for the reform of the law on the marijuana .
&quot; have last therefore time moment to people to the courts that , in reality , still not can accept that be legal &quot; , said .
The be the first States that they the small quantities of marijuana of the same way that if outside alcohol , mistreated and Washington prepare for become in the cases of test to national level in as to the legalisation of drugs .
While lawyers and officials the state have with a new border of legal sales , also expect receive Finns indications the government Federal , that still for the consideration of the sale and the as of marijuana as federal crimes .
The defenders of the legalisation of the marijuana have the hope of that department of justice i .
To despite of that have been some leading arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for for therapeutic , the government Federal has allowed in their majority that there business of sale of marijuana with these for in mistreated , Washington and 16 States more .
&quot; although is likely that players integrates not doors from for boxes an exchange of small drugs , probably will averse to allow the functioning of shops regulated the state for the sale of marijuana for use hand , one in the new law &quot; , said Kevin A. Sabet , a of policy integrates of the administration of Obama .
Several cities of mistreated not expect to that act the federal authorities .
Even before the day of the elections , some local governments number moratoriums on any new shop of marijuana , to despite of that will around of a year before of that who of them can open .
The last week , the city Western of Montrose adopted a ban of six months and is likely that I the week that next .
&quot; we not .ut in a situation in the coexist to someone and then we a serious problem to level Federal &quot; , he Geldof Nicholson , Member the City .
&quot; our Community voted in against of this amendment .
We at to favour of what that voted the Community with to vote to favour of what that voted the state . &quot;
many Arise questions the regard .
Petronella Wyatt : &quot; I to down of Oxford be a hunted &quot;
Not strikes to the it their points of view only now
Not remember no time in my life in the not has state boggles in to a place in the University of Oxford .
Therefore my father as my brother greater had state in the I supposed was the better place the world for learn , a symposium Greek of the was contemporary that employee the two pillars of the civilisation : the free thinking and the tolerance .
Sin however , to the two weeks of should my place in the Worcester College to end of the years 80 for welcome the career of history , already had fact the packed , what that triggered the first scandal of my life .
My father crumbled and retraced to our .
My friends were there .
The newspaper the Evening Standard said that I had abandoned because not that some colleagues of University maintained sexual relations in the room of the on .
The A. N. Wilson announced that I had gone because I thrown to drinking in .
The truth was least funny .
Huí of there .
Sí , , because had state put to a systematic harassment and intimidation .
Not because to my name , not the fact of that from of a private school .
I a only reason , that in the cradle of the conciliation illustration was something to and barbaric : my father , the Patriarch Woodrow Wyatt , was a striking advisory of Margaret Thatcher and I install the party Conservative .
Perhaps ask to what next that now .
Well , several reports show a new generation of students of centre right is suffering a similar persecution .
The hatred institutionalised and growing towards the students the party Conservative is such in Oxford the last week , a group of them called the same level of equality of rights that have the homosexuals , the disabled and the ethnic minorities .
Member Conservatives of the JCR ( grouping of students of degree ) the corpus Christi College claim that are &quot; to often seriously paragraphs , personally attacked and treaties as people not objected &quot; their ideas policies .
Want create a since in the Committee of equality of opportunities of their school university for ensure of power express their views freely .
Their situation not was cyberspace a recent documentary of the BBC2 called &quot; Wonderland : Young , Bright and as the Right &quot; ( the paradise : young , it and of right ) on the policy of the students and that presented to the Tories as and BNP .
Mostraba the student of master Joe Cooke , of the partnership the party Conservative of the University of Oxford ( OUCA ) , in a Rolls-Royce , wearing a suit silver and a bullfighting with the of silver .
In other universities , the students Conservatives say that them is as &quot; them of Turkish &quot; the introduction of rates of plate more higher .
Luke Black , of 20 years and of of the partnership the party Conservative of the University of damage , declared in a newspaper transcript that &quot; there a growing trend of left in the universities .
The people moderating that we as the Bullingdon club not so even &quot; .
Samuel Albert , of 21 years and student of history in corpus Christi that presented the motion for a greater protection , says that environment is &quot; you &quot; , while that Stephanie Cherill , of 19 years and President elected of the OUCA , says that attitude of the Member of the JCR towards the people that are of centre right has worsened .
&quot; this is a threat for the environment of intellectual debate , so as for the welfare of the Member &quot; , says .
For my first weeks in Oxford was more single that .
I in the University in September of 1986 , was a young of 18 years turmoil timid .
The hatred towards the party Conservative was in their point more high .
The previous year , the University had voted can to Margaret Thatcher , former , a title &quot; honorary cause &quot; after the cuts in the funding of the education higher .
The environment would fact horrifying of appalling to any Stalinist .
Already for the first days of the week of welcome to the new it , when the new students know and know to the professors , received a shows of the bitterness that I than .
Thoroughly that professors not only the view blind to the was of the it Conservatives , but that involved in she of good earns .
The policy of the strike of the miners , the privatisation and the opposition the government to the sanctions against the Apartheid in Africa came to the rooms of wood the seminar .
The first that I be speak the English texts French the century centuries and I not was ready for what that wine to continuation .
&quot; Señorita Wyatt &quot; , said the professor Harry Pitt ( already died ) , &quot; favour , translates the first paragraph &quot; .
Not realised not a .
Pitt , a man with a face that seemed mass of , was well how who bad .
&quot; is that refuse to learn French or is that , simply , are thinks ? &quot; , asked .
The other it laughed .
I compared the eyes of the tears that was of contain .
&quot; you suggest that will to classes of French in their free time , always and when is not too occupied as people &quot; , Pitt .
Returned to my room as a soul in it .
That night I sat single to the time of the dinner in the University ; then felt this straight in the on .
Was a student of English of second year called James that presented as Member of the OUCA .
&quot; know who you &quot; , I said politely .
&quot; I fear that so is as is the thing .
Se mouths with who that be suspect of be hunted .
For me is very complicated , but know that your father is have to Margaret Thatcher , so that for you will still worst .
Many Tories would newcomers be Labour &quot; .
More forward , in a local lunches , tried Corbi hide .
Stressed in that not was of agreement with all what that said the Sra. Thatcher .
That trick s pointless .
A student of first year of philosophy , policies and economy that , paradoxically , had examined in Eton , said : &quot; you daughter of a pig fascist .
With would &quot; .
Other students adopted that .
I became in the laundry .
&quot; how have sexual relations the Tories ? &quot; , asked one .
&quot; Se are a him the one the another , not ? &quot;
I felt of the same way that should have sense the homosexuals before of the law liberal of the years 60 .
Could some day to a normal life in Oxford ?
I be forced to be with people that advise as I only after the ?
Would that plenty Labour and suppressed my natural trends ?
The three years that I were were as a purgatory of assumption and isolation .
The only professor openly hunted was Norman Sexual , Professor of contemporary history aimed to my school university .
You be not only the party Conservative , but also advisory of Thatcher in foreign policy and a of the people that you go their speeches .
Hardly was there .
Detestaba the place that what he parochial and it and their wet to the vision marxista-determinista of the history .
In 1997 accepted a university in the University of Bilkent , in Ankara , Turkey .
&quot; here not you to be happy &quot; , I said .
I to visit daily of Oxford to home of my parents in London , finding refuge in my family and friends of mentality city more open .
You I to my father that hated Oxford and what .
Not I believed .
When he long there in the years 40 , deleting all the points of political view .
&quot; but if is the better place the world &quot; , said with sadness .
&quot; them never would that , not there between my dear needlestick of dream .
To my friends Communist always had an attitude whiter &quot; .
Their eyes they to .
&quot; other Dale opportunity .
Am sure of that what have fact only for .
Se I Tipperary the heart if what . &quot;
Structural of many travel to London , my emotional resistance was deteriorating .
A friend mine , that also install the party Conservative , had succumbed to the pressure and had renounced to their cultures .
The week next , for a seminar in the another professor of history had hinted , about completely in seriously , that I was a &quot; enemy the people &quot; , decided to what same .
Red of shame within , that my parents I had &quot; laundering the which &quot; and them notified &quot; old stupid &quot; .
The for little time .
Was my father who it the last coffin in the coffin of my career university in Oxford .
Por at then my father illiterate two week in the press of Murdoch .
My door was closed with key .
I was within of fear and , automatic five minutes , my revival .
When were i the GDR and took the first train to London .
Never returned .
Perhaps I weak .
But no person of 18 years should be put to such level of intimidation and hostility in an institution amusing .
What that is still more tragic is that was Oxford , that not only has have to 14 first ministers the party Conservative but that , to day of today , behind after an ensure nothing vilnius of equality and freedom of thinking .

Singapore search babies for save the economy
The blaming to the career , the stress and the costs of the properties and the education not have children .
&quot; the population of Singapore needs grow &quot; .
Am a husband murdering , you my wife , ! do with our duty civic and we life !
Can appear be that these idly are part of an announcement of tablets of , but to despite of that - or perhaps because to that - the webstreaming the in YouTube in Singapore to principles of this year .
The sentences are part of a rap that used no local as &quot; we to to a ( ) in the oven &quot; for laughing of the rate of birth of Singapore .
The company of advertising that was the webstreaming , BBH , thailand the hope of that with the announcement forgetting draw the attention on the problem of a way funny .
Their creative director , Douglas Hamilton , says that wanted use the power of the music for that people ! with &quot; their national duty &quot; .
This is something purely of Internet , so that had that do fun and funny .
Is the greater problem in this country .
We the worst the world in to us ourselves , so that we that was an issue that we that address .
Knew that government had tried many things , as launch perfumes with or organise of from carriers ( speed-dating ) .
Many of these ideas can have been creative , but not necessarily worked .
So that we , what we not .hat more creative possible for right this problem , that is a rap ?
1.2 children
The not what the so to the is the government of Singapore .
Spent US $ 1.300 the year in policies for encourage to the citizens to have more children .
A package the government for marriages and parents make to 15.000 dollars child , or the licences leave and spread profits tax .
But all this has had little effect .
Singapore is a city state rich and of high technology in the Asia of Asia , also known the conservatism of their leaders and their needed social controls .
The rate of birth of Singapore , of agreement with their national division of population , at currently in 1.2 children woman .
The last time that was above of 2 -conocida as rate of reposición- was in 1976 .
So that what the not have more children ?
So Wei Ming , there of policies of marriage and family of the national division of population , says that is because to a &quot; better education &quot; and &quot; a range more wider of opportunities of career &quot; .
&quot; that you has allowed to the people have of a range more wider of options in terms of objectives of life and priorities , more beyond of marriage and be a family &quot; , it .
These changes in the social rules have contributed the increase of the , and to delay the marriage and the births , what that as result a in of the rate of birth in Singapore .
While therefore , a policy of immigration EU is to increase drastically the immigration for to with to the in of the population has created umbrage between the local population .
In Singapore there websites website where rife the xenophobia hardly disguised against many new immigrants , in particular the Chinese , to the critics keep the wages Netherlands and not integrated .
The increase of the immigration also is seen as a of the reasons the last year the party of government of Singapore chilling their worst electoral result since the independence .
Since the elections has there an attempt of right the problem , with the quotas and taxes more higher for the foreign workers .
Consequences some
While that fall in the rate of birth has effects known in the economic growth of a nation , the income tax , the costs health and the policies of immigration , the example of Singapore also is taking some consequences some .
The government is that not built many small houses .
Por example , has started to affect the sector estate .
The authority of development urban has last to control the number of over small , known as &quot; box of shoes &quot; , that they build in certain areas of the city .
These over have land of 46 square metres and have had a success of sales .
Sin however , there concern of that they promote a lifestyle of life of and to the developers that want build houses large , family .
But Lim Lee Soon , general director of the company buildings the Developers , says that their &quot; boxes of shoes &quot; sold a more quickly that units more large .
Are more popular , in the sense of that units exhausted days , even weeks , more quickly that units of greater size .
This ago that be a better for our flow of box .
Sin however , accepts that new rules are guidelines more clear for the developers , to the before them disposal snags if wanted offer too units small in a project .
Too
Singapore is a city state .
If well these new rules can be a step towards the increase of the rate of birth national , the about with the working in the financial district the centre prompt that not will to have an effect .
&quot; the people is very Marge , the houses are sides and also what is the education , what that many people what are they &quot; , says a young executive .
Other people can have children .
&quot; but for me is important have with my own money and time &quot; , says another young of a 20 years .
Men and women mention their career , the stress and the costs of the properties and of the education as the for that them from have children .
So a that government involved of force to their citizens to have children , when is of to babies , the are who have the last word .
What private found found is private as found
Privacy .
Of agreement with the – of the real Academy Spanish is of the quality of private or &quot; the area of the life private that has right to protect of any intrusion &quot; .
What is private for a will of 16 years ?
How applies this definition in their life daily and in the social networks ?
Understand the dangers to the is which in Internet situations that surely not outside of line ?
Malashenko to five boys of between ten and 15 years , users frequent of the network .
In four of the cases , the term to &quot; something very mine &quot; , in the personal level , and &quot; in the key and name the user &quot; , when what applied to social networks .
&quot; my secret more profound not the going to an ex &quot; , says Borg , of ten years , when is explain the meaning of private in websites as Facebook , Twitter , hotmail and Windows Live Messenger , where has accounts since ago two years .
&quot; are secret very secret , my you can it , but not all the world &quot; , says .
In FB images fine or of games .
Also I with my known .
&quot; not a photograph that not be my , or of someone that is doing the ourselves &quot; , says .
The child recognised that is publish photographs , of people naked , of crimes or write comments humiliating or violent .
Borg will know to the 35 friends that has in FB and to their nine followers in Twitter .
The majority are kith .
The mother is including , has the key of a of the accounts .
Abrí Twitter for case and write interesting .
&quot; not know if I , I only the &quot; , adds .
&quot; the social networks are humorous , can about with kith distant or with my friends of way fast &quot; , that .
Not doubt in answer that never accept a request of a person unknown .
Not you would case to someone that you recognise to a strange .
The case of José , of 14 years , is different .
The girl has open accounts in hotmail , Facebook , circumspect Space and Ask , in this last accepts not know to 20 of the people in their list of friends .
&quot; not I frightens , because we something in common , the music example &quot; , that .
According the child , none you has hinted not you has asked the direction of their home or their number of telephone .
&quot; if I or I what simply the together of my account &quot; , recognised .
José was he of Ask , then of read a recommendation in Twitter .
The child not you are which the experiences of what that today known as .
To a known of a my her what were in a social network .
What it and you demanded money .
&quot; never it who was &quot; , will .
The victim , according José , not closed the account .
&quot; only you it privacy &quot; .
Then it a series of steps for assess the account of way safe .
To difference of Borg , this saddened going photos of known in uncomfortable situations or putting .
Sí what would , if I you or you have wish .
&quot; although know that is &quot; , says .
Questions key
Marielos Porras , masterpiece of English and graduate in education and learning , as that for guide to the children and to the adolescents must should that purpose of the social networks is inform .
&quot; Internet about as a for to information , but with the of these websites changed the rules the at &quot; , mentions .
Porras out that academic BEF Prensky , degree in Pedagogía the University of Yale and author of the labour native and immigrants digital , coined these terms for explain the phenomenon .
The native digital are them , the children and young that born with the technology .
&quot; us we the immigrants digital that we that taught to them , when still we to &quot; , says .
Observing that issue is complex , &quot; because them we asking that have a criterion defined on what be or not salvage , publish or say to an age that expression not for that &quot; .
&quot; also that are was when what that more them care is be popular , have thousands of friends think in the consequences &quot; , adds .
According the specialist , the way more effective of teach what is privacy to children and adolescents is to through of questions that do think .
&quot; tell that not what do not it &quot; , .
To continuation , Porras lists some options : there things that not you to a strange , what what pensioner in Internet ?
Or , you like that now a photograph of you as the of a friend ?
Know what that other are on you ?
When labels photos of testing , permit to the other people for ?
And a more , all need know what what with doing every time ?
Another point is them see that must act as found as what do found found .
Are the same rules .
&quot; one outside of Internet it with respect , morality and other principles , as must be in the social networks &quot; , says .
Surveillance
Estuardo in , professor university , Professor of primary and Danish education , observing that is essential that parents of family read to awareness the policies of the social networks .
The understand every one of the them have strong foundations for speak with their children on the implications of open an account in Internet .
&quot; Por example , the age and what that is allowed share or publish &quot; , says .
Of agreement with in , is key remember to the children the lesson of &quot; not with strangers &quot; .

&quot; Suramérica must learn of Europe for integrate a citizenship &quot; : Raphael Correa
The President of Ecuador , Raphael Correa , said today that creation of a citizenship common is a target in the &quot; Suramérica , in this case , must learn of Europe &quot; .
Correa , that part in the I summit presidential of the Union of nations Suramericanas ( Unasur ) , held in Lima , declared to the state TV Peru that European &quot; killed in the second war World &quot; and in other conflicts , &quot; but now are virtually a homeland &quot; .
For , in that sense , the project of establish the citizenship that encouraged the countries Member of the Unasur .
&quot; there that to the free mobility of citizens and workers any country , as already happens with the those of the Community Andean , but still there sectors that we want restore the last &quot; , warned .
The President Ecuadorean was , also , to favour of the up of the organisation of States Americans ( AEO ) under the premise of down the influence of the States Continental and have in account to the have signed the Pact of St José on the rights human .
The are university never themselves to nothing and , in change , us the what arrangement all .
&quot; is incomprehensible that Commission which of human rights is in Washington under the funding of States United &quot; , said in referring the political asylum given Ecuador the founder of WikiLeaks , Julian Assange .
Correa was that is not of that decision because with this not has betrayed their principles , but that has respected their &quot; profound democratic values and of human rights &quot; .
But that , in their time , &quot; had OLAF arrests of that Assange outside extradited to a third country and not it their process &quot; .
Reputed , also , to the justice Swedish observance that able in their territory the interrogation an alleged sexual crime when &quot; the own legislation Swedish allows satisfy by video , that could to since the Embassy of Ecuador in London &quot; .
Correa said that there the risk of that deteriorate the physical health and mental of Assange .
&quot; not I about with he since that is in our Embassy , but the her I informed that had a small problem allegedly , serious nothing &quot; , said the event Ecuadorean .
What that there is the danger of that deteriorate their physical health and mental be he in a small space power to exercises the free air .
&quot; that complicates the health of any person &quot; , But .
Correa pointed that solution the asylum orientates to Assange since June in the Embassy in London , by the granting of a that you to travel to Ecuador , is in hands of great Britain , Sweden and the legal European authorities and it that has there discussions with London in search of a solution the founder of WikiLeaks .
Us not negotiate with human rights , that word not the we in this case , but has there permanent discussions .
&quot; the solution of this problem is in hands of great Britain , Sweden and of the legal European authorities because the lawyer of Assange , Baltazar Baltasar , is doing a series of procedures in different European bodies &quot; , mentioned .
And opinion that &quot; if great Britain morning the convince this has &quot; .
And if Sweden , as perfectly what allows their legislation and as has fact in other cases , the mr Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London or what to Skype morning same has this problem .
Correa availed for failure as a Ombudsman of the freedom of press and that what that not does is &quot; the mediocrity , the bad faith and the lie , that weaken the freedom of expression &quot; .
&quot; the over enemies of the freedom of press we not .he political villains and wicked but the bad journalists in role the profit , the blackmail and the extortion &quot; , said .
In that aspect welcomed that already not are these journalists &quot; not the bankers not the hegemonic countries and class the dominated to Ecuador &quot; , and forward that of be his &quot; in the revolution for continue the way and the direction right &quot; .
Correa also supported the decision of keep the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur the least to their next elections , the further that Agency &quot; must be firm and not tolerate the opportunism and the fraught of legality &quot; because in reality &quot; shall the legitimacy of the democracy &quot; .
The President Ecuadorean was , also , &quot; perfectly relevant &quot; the wish of their counterpart response , Juan Manuel holy , of negotiate now with Nicaragua the limits seaports between both countries after the failure of the international Court of justice of the has , that influences to the sovereignty maritime .
Por the time not by that failure .
Is a problem between a country facilitates and one .
The conflicts are inevitable , but must be overcome the will of moving together .
There that them of way wider for resolved and to forward .
Also employee in a good conclusion the dispute limits seaports that are in the same Court Peru and Chile and opinion that &quot; is right for America Latin to international bodies if the two countries themselves to accept failure hard that be &quot; .
In reference to the possibility that present as candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador for to a third mandate running pointed that is that possibility &quot; with an optimism and joy , although to sometimes is quite hard &quot; .
Correa was that if lose the at of February the 2013 will of the life public .
In what personal never I has interested the power , but in situations so upon as the of Ecuador that poverty highlight only can right since the political power .
&quot; my movement believed that was I who defaults that likely victory , therefore we that accept that &quot; , said .
Of earn would my last period in the Presidency and of there are of the life public .
If we as .
&quot; is a decision &quot; , said .
Correa he also the new treatment of health the President which Hugo Chávez in Cuba .
Just of about with the of which Claus Maduro and I says that was to a treatment that already was planned , of routine , that expectation that pass the campaign for again to Cuba .
&quot; not means a he in the state of health the President Chávez &quot; , a .
The head of state Ecuadorean part today in Lima in the I summit of Heads of state and government of the Union of nations Suramericanas ( Unasur ) that brought with called to a greater regional integration for holding the progress , the equality and the security .

Now is possible survive to this syndrome and do with quality of life .
Sin however , ignorant of their disease , still many people they when the virus already has caused havoc , &quot; reached &quot; their system immune and are victims of opportunistic infections .
To 31 years of the emergence the AIDS in the world , the least of the first cases reported , &quot; the great achievement means in this time that of a patient that as treatment in way have and the of the population general , is exactly as &quot; , pressed the head of the unit of HIV the HCG , Jaime Andrade Villanueva , after referring that information was Therefore in April of this year in a publication scientific .
Infectólogo and expert in HIV / AIDS , Andrade Villanueva a that since the year 2008 , the scientists had completed that AIDS not was a ruling fatal , but the years of survival and the quality of life on the degree of the system immune that have the patients the to the diagnosis , with better expectation for who not are users of drugs : of to 30 years with a of 200 CD4 and of 50 years , when our 500 CD4 .
In words simple , what previous means that who a diagnosis of positive HIV to the 25 years of age , under these terms &quot; while it in control will live problems to the 75 years &quot; , he the interviewed .
For this progress , is remember that hope of life of the Mexican today is of 76 years in average .
If well the mortality has down significantly in the last years , in the case of Mexico , the number of people that die of AIDS bowed of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 ( annual of UNAIDS ) , also is true that since the emergence the AIDS , 60 cent of the patients in the basis of national data have died .
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011 , and will 187 deaths to May of this year ; not however will that there access universal to the opportunistic drugs since 2005 .
- Por what still they deaths ?
- to me I seems that problem is not of access to treatment .
So what , so we has happened in our hospital .
The least in the last 12 years we not .ad of medicine the problem is that patients they very advanced because not their state of infection , or be , in late stages of the disease .
Was a fact no : &quot; nine of every ten patients they when already have any infection instrumental what that has that to for have a greater impact on the global mortality , is to verdicts more and , what therefore , have that offer evidence of detection of way mass , to all the people that what overnight &quot; .
In their proposal line specialists and officials the Council state of prevention the AIDS in Jalisco ( Coesida ) , also the own patients , as Fabrizio , who out to done the test to a particular laboratory , only drove because what had fact a friend and , despite to their short age , already was in stage of AIDS and even of Kaposi , a by cancerous that is a of the common complications .
All time when know that you AIDS .
Some think that will to die and not want know nothing .
&quot; if already I i to die , better I three sometimes to the week &quot; , say not in my case .
The change was for improve , I food well , I exercise , say the medicines .
To the date , their parents only know that cancer .
Live a normal life , as who .
&quot; work , have many activities , I , have a sexual active life , but complicity , I to me and to the other person &quot; , Fabrizio , who accepted share their privacy with Millennium JALISCO for motivate with their that to who today , in the framework the day World the AIDS , have fear .
That do the test , if had risk , that between more soon know if are positive HIV , is better and if already have the diagnosis , that learn that can live as any person , being responsible .
That , their message , sums the motto of battle the AIDS this 2012 .
Condoms after the counter
Large are the missed that there between the programmes of health and the common citizen , affirmed Regil Salazar , journalist who has taken the cause in about the HIV .
And the more large is in prevention .
In the places dedicated to this task &quot; indeed has increased the of condoms , before we by of one or two , now we are packages of to hundred , and that is very well but is that there who today , still , not have access to a prostitute &quot; , said .
Between the more vulnerable to new infections are the adolescents .
&quot; for what the your ? &quot; is common question , with plaything and trials of value of social workers , schoolchildren , employees of dispensing and personal of health , to the not want forward the adolescents , was the communicator .
Proposed order this ineffective the ; that condoms not are only after the desks and these hundred are in of public bathing of the websites that frequent the young .
Not is motivate the as .
Not is of paying the and the , as replied the Governor Emilio González , the ask if would the of condoms in their administration .
&quot; so is not the acceptance , what better is closer the condoms to who already profess an sexual activity &quot; , pointed .
He in Jalisco
There 13.435 cumulative cases ( 12.158 of AIDS and 1.317 of HIV ) .
The state is 4 ° place national in cases new and cumulative of AIDS and 13 ° of HIV .
92 % of the as is to the to sexual , 6 % to the to protect and 2 % to the to .
Se estimated that 50 billion people can be living with HIV already a case reported there of 4 to 5 people that not what know .
Resting a Court of appeals of States United a ruling that unknown the restructuring of the debt the group vitro agreed to a law in Mexico , the stage put a precedent harmful for any national company with apparatus in the neighbour country that have problems of solvency .
Se say , therefore , that procedures in earn of survival of the signatures that it the laws Mexican not are valid in the country of the bars and the stars , to of international conventions .
In the practical ground , the boost to the ruling issued the 15 of last June the judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bancarrotas for the district North of Texas , is to the signatures Mexican with to the possibility of however of their properties in the bravo .
Sin however , the resolution you opens the door to the main manufacturer of glass in Mexico for come to the Court by of the States United , say three inconsistencies .
Of entry , while the judge of the cause out that creditors must regulated the law of bankruptcies of the States United , the Court of appeals the fifth Circuito , with headquarters in new Orleans , says that procedure main is the law Söderman in Mexico .
The first point costly unaware the cooperation international prosecution in cases of insolvency of companies with profile .
Of fact , towards that end was the law model of nations UN for the sameness the right international law , as umpire the American Law Institute .
In second place , the ruling for that vote , recognised in the mass criticism the law the debts that they with their parent the will of vitro , not would achieved the majority required for approve the restructuring .
Sin however , the possibility the recognise the laws Mexican .
Of fact , the of vitro not has been the first case in that on the scheme .
There are average dozen of examples , between them Agremex and trade Mexican , whose debts the Institute Federal of notice Mercantiles .
What true , also , is that recompensed the votes of the will , of all case the creditors of vitro that against this in the explained of States United , is say the funds &quot; &quot; as Aurelios capital , Aurelios convergence , international Elliot and Liverpool were , not will achieved majority .
The vote would been of 45 cent against 37 .
The fact what asking the Court of appeals .
Since another angle , this fault to vitro of the situation difficult that Brigades to from the 2008 to lecture of the serious economic crisis that Brigades States United , the country .
Por what soon , the signing of the family González Sada courts an appeal of embark to the own Court of appeals for that vote it the plenary of this , is say the five officers , given that only voted three .
Of not bear this will the appeal of Cerciorare that requires the review the process part of a ultimately higher , in this case the by Court of justice of the States United .
What serious the case is that Court a document sent the government of Mexico under the on of ( &quot; friend of the Court &quot; ) , in the procedure followed vitro under the framework of the law of notice Mercantiles , by that with adhering to the conventions signed both countries for this with the chapter 15 of the law of Bancarrotas of the States United .
More still , out that country to the principles of the Commission of the nations UN for the international trade , is say the rules by for transboundary cases of insolvency , a fairness for debtors and creditors .
Carambola of two gangs : you hitting to vitro and you hitting the country .

Of &quot; Hetin &quot; on : &quot; the in has been my life &quot;
Trotamundos the in of &quot; Hetin &quot; on was more of 60 years concerned the sport the and , thank to he , was the world whole .
Few people in port Puerto has a mental harvest of the history the in local so wider as the has of &quot; Hetin &quot; on .
And is that before of an eating acquiring what to a wheelchair of wheelchair in the 2008 , on was pawn in the sport more of 60 years , it as player of categories age , player the in higher national , helplessness and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros of Bayamón or President of the Federation of in .
&quot; I I many in the in to through of my life , including several to the same time , as when was President the BSN , workforce general the team national and President for the years 90 &quot; , reminded on for a visit of first time to their home in Bayamón , where lies with Isabel , their faithful wife more of 50 years .
&quot; the in has been my life &quot; .
On not it the to that experienced .
The walls of their home , almost all with photos and that understands their wider very , so what point .
Bayamón in the heart
Of all , the i with greater taught are the their step the Vaqueros since in of the of the 50 as player to 1982 , when perform 15 years as or helplessness of the abolishing .
&quot; these were my best years , the more I because had the opportunity of be part of eight Hockey of the Vaqueros since 1967 , already it as helplessness , or leader .
Were many years of , including the five Hockey since 1971 to 1975 .
And then I farewell with one in the 1981 , the year of debut of Jerome Mincy in the BSN .
Of there in forward was office &quot; Cuco &quot; Ortiz , that was a great administrator &quot; , pressed on .
Remember that Gene Bartow , that had at here and was in the University of Alabama ( Birmingham ) , I said : &quot; you have a player well strong , of 6 &quot; 7 &quot; of stature .
What your ? &quot;
And that was the principle of Mincy , one of the best players that has had port Puerto .
Bartow then recommended the Raymond Gausse , that was and was one of our best competitions .
Remember that said that if Mincy you had given a championship to Bayamon , Gausse help to bring another more .
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse what , but already to the distance , therefore for 1988 already one of .
For that time would enjoy of their and the of Mincy in the national team .
Remember when you we first time to States United for the Preolímpico in Mexico of 1989 .
Then wine the World of 1990 , where we fourth place and was have been bronze of not be at Canadian umpire that we was repeat the ground end second time , said on .
That group the World of 1990 is the better national team that paca seen ?
Is between the best , as that you won the Dream Team in the Hulten of 2004 .
But my bookmakers was the of the Panamericanos in Cuba in 1991 , when we gold and you we a team of States United , that was quite similar the we won the bronze in the World .
At team not only to Mincy , Gausse , Ramon Rivas , Choice Valverde and &quot; Piculín &quot; ( Ortiz ) , but that also had to ( Javier ) &quot; Toñito &quot; Columbus and James argues young , to the Muslim a ( which and Karadzic ) and to Mario &quot; novel &quot; Evo , that not had been be in the 90 because to an injury in the diktat .
A team that perhaps not was the better in terms of personal , but we was a medal of gold and a great joy was the Preolímpico the 1995 in Neuquén , Argentina .
With players of role as &quot; Canito &quot; Nieves , Paul Alicea and a youth Rolando Hourruitiner in alternative of the players suspended the we the Panamericano of sea the silver , we gold against all the prospects .
What has been the better player of port Puerto ?
Sin doubt any , that has been Piculín Ortiz .
Their numbers to level of international are impressive .
Nobody in port Puerto has by to that level as what was Piculín .
And that have their very in the different have that rugby .
Who has been the better leader ?
That is very difficult .
We had a very good that includes to July nettle , prime Meléndez , emperor Evo , Raymond lively , Armandito Torres .
Of the young , I like a work of shall Arill .
What your greater achievement in the Federation ?
Have been part of the was more the national team between 1988 and 1995 and that to beginning of the 90 the BSN had to 17 equipment in a season .
What you became to ?
There things that would wanted implement , as the regionalisation of the categories age .
Por example , that boys of Ponce only in their area and only equipment of other they of the island in the national .
Now same the children travel and lives too of way unnecessary .
The least see the emerged of the certification and course for leaders , official of table and referees .
That I am .
What pensioner now ?
What more that I is listen music , see avert of the music of my time in YouTube , to my grandchildren and of time in when go to games of in .
And clear , enjoy of the company of my wife , Isabel , that always has state me .

Every week , the students subjects as the war nuclear , the unaware , the virus and germs , and the global warming .
This six , when the Professor in religion Stuart Charmé decided offence a course on the end the world , was that had with a : the end of the &quot; long account &quot; the timetable Maya , the 21 of December , the have clings many people as a test of that next the end the world .
But Charmé not had idea of what that you than in the next couple of months : the Hurricane Sandy , a precipice tax that some have called &quot; &quot; and a growing conflict that involves to Israel , the place where the theoretical Christians the end of the times believe that will the Apocalypse .
&quot; not I realised account of that was to be the six more apocalyptic that has there &quot; , said Charmé this week to the students of the University Rutgers-Camden ( new Jersey ) .
If one analysing what that has state happening in the world today in day as if we to 30 days and up , this has been a period really good .
And remember that bad is good for those of mentality thereby .
And he is not only Professor that offers courses on the &quot; end the world &quot; this six , in theory the last of the history .
In Temple , the Professor Deputy Simpson Vacker is running the course &quot; media , culture and the end the world &quot; .
Every week , the students subjects as the war nuclear , the unaware , the virus and germs , and the global warming .
&quot; we what these ideas rife with the time &quot; , said , and the way in that offered hypothetical scenarios that certain inform for human .
If the material nuclear you in hands of terrorists , example , could were a war .
This month the students study films with subjects and how compare with examples of the life real .
&quot; I Treaty of inform to the students on what that is possible , likely , credible and impossible &quot; , said Vacker .

We messages electronic email for weeks and weeks before the beginning the six , of people that wondering if still had place .
The students , their part , they that course is one of the more interesting .
&quot; I is fascinating see what that do the people for to same &quot; , said Bridgid Mr , a student of the career in religion and Sociology of 23 years of Haddonfield , new Jersey , in Rutgers-Camden .
And is that mentality thereby , secular or religious , is only question of comfort or of the lack the same .
Will Wekesa , a student of the career of Psicología and Enfermería , of 25 years , said have seen all the films .
&quot; never had heard on a class that could teach that &quot; , pressed .
What i .
But no student interviewed - and a least a Professor - said believe in the date of uncertain the 21 of December .
&quot; our first project was on the prophecy and of certain way what &quot; , said Julie Zeglen , student of last year in Temple , of 21 years and of West Chester .
The never the end the world ; is so only a key point in the timetable , said Restall .
But that there a breath thereby in the culture Western , that back to several centuries , in that people react to the changes to their around the end the world .
Internet has caused a on of these speculation .
&quot; in other both the people not think in this &quot; , said .
In mostly in the world of about English .
Joseph Dougherty , a Professor of religion of the University the Salle that orders courses in the Filipinas this year , replied quickly to the question of if was on some course on the &quot; end the world &quot; there .
&quot; the Filipinas not involved in the end the world &quot; , wrote , implying an exception of an authority higher .
We a pardon the Pope .
Restall was hold that to what long of the years has about of many days the trial end , and said that if is not nothing the 21 of December , &quot; the people will to think of immediately in the next date &quot; or to that 21 of December is the beginning of a period of seven years the out of the which will the world .
Students and teachers are taking to the date .
Several said that think go to testing &quot; the end the world &quot; .
such &quot; time have to some friends for that we together &quot; , a Samira Ford , student of communications of 20 years .
