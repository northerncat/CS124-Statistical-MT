On on of a child : not and dinner pressed
More of a third of the children with age percentage between the 9 and 13 years have problems of obesity , where the obesity affects the 9 % of the population school and the obesity the 5 % .
The children overweight from in their majority of families with a lifestyle of life that is not healthy , according from of current research .
Se again to demonstrate what is the importance the environment where overall for a development healthy of the person , so as the models that serve of reference .
In the table , the children discriminatory , example , of pressed the least with the double of often that children of families with normal weight .
For dinner , more the 19 % of the overweight had potatoes the day before the analysis , the which is linked the programme of prevention &quot; the obesity is not a &quot; .
In the families of children with obesity not there preparation of people sports , what which is applies to the majority of the current families , where only the 15 % of the children replied that their parents , the least a time week , are time for the physical exercise .
Survey so to 900 children
The survey was to end the last year school and took in the same almost 900 children of basic education of whole keeping .
Already was the second edition the programme of &quot; the obesity of is not a &quot; , that supports the company of sure health general and the company Unilever .
To now , have participated in the project more of 12 billion children since the 4º to the 8º course .
An appropriate and quite exercise in family are factors , that do decrease a number of children with obesity and even obesity .
&quot; only the half of the children have would that have five lunches joys according the regime : Breakfast , lunch , food , and dinner , that is a of the conditions in for a healthy &quot; , other one of the results of the survey .
Sin Breakfast but with for dinner
The specialists of that , in a development healthy , are important , also , the details , that also have , as example have a time set for the Breakfast in family .
In keeping , not however , only the 23 % of the families of schoolchildren to the same time .
In the majority of the families , every one only .
But what worst was be that in the 10 % of the who not nothing .
The Breakfast is , however , the basis of a daily right .
The study shows that in the families of children overweight consume with very more often the potatoes .
Almost all - regardless the weight - they to on ( 70 % ) .
Por rule general do sport more the 40 % of the children , however , pronounced their parents this result reduces to least of the half , only the 15 % .
Fabrícate your
The next stage the study that elected ( 204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools ) their own which to from of all the at possible according their tastes and views .
&quot; the preference food of the children Czech in age percentage between the 12 and 15 years , since the point of view of a food healthy , are very removed of what ideal . &quot;
Between their food favourite are the meat and the
&quot; is on all alarming the popularity of the &quot; , by in the report end the study .
As food main has the Palma the and you still of close the meat of subsiding .
Virtually , the children reject always the and the will the fish and the I is very under .
Change to habits made
The same time , the study shows that children are prepared to change their habits food if receive the information fair .
&quot; in the group of control of the participants in the study , that after of end the programme of prevention &quot; the obesity is not a &quot; , was in many cases a important change to favour of the principles of a food healthy &quot; , as in the results the study .
Is the attention , example , what as to the , where many children to the normal water and aware .
The children also with more often in the meat of subsiding and the fish for the food main and the consumption of fresh food and the derivatives of .
The has of be also a good Guillermo , maintain the professionals
In the Article , how about the , already I a little of that initial lessons already were quite .
Not had not idea of how would for .
Conferences of three professionals the , how tight to eventual problem and , also , a seminar on how works in the world the spectacle .
And will worst .
As more close are the examinations end , more information and tasks practices we
And although the course develops every Saturday and Sunday , already is not a .
We time we examined with the there , Alena , ( in the course not there no man ) on how tight to the woman that not has a perfect .
And so is the great majority .
Someone is , someone has a on the right and someone suffering obesity .
The has of know arise a shoulders , a bottleneck or the necessary
We have given certain noticed on how to i the body of women the kind of Jennifer Valverde , of and enormous but close and the same time not of a way too
If , example , the difference between the and the is so that skirt or the trousers not , is the it done the least a paper of manipulated to measure .
Sin doubt not , because the clothes that where perfectly is .
With a skirt to measure relieved a better that with a that not for of ! , , in the , etc.
The body can allow tight clothes with , , or .
There certainly many types of various information and of bodies , so that am readjust of that have of whole the week for to order in my head whole this information .
And even so , I fear that with the task , already have more that of too .
To every participant in the course you have allocated two famous , to the must solutions two : one for the day and another for the night .
There that have in account the current aspect , the lifestyle of fashionable that to the person in question .
I has &quot; tight &quot; to Miranda Kerr , perhaps the of the campaign of victory &apos; at Secret .
Out within , for me is a better that , example , Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera , that recently will a hundred double ( favour , have in account the excessive ) , or the Selena Gómez .
The overalls we that of the weeklies or in Internet and , for after wholeheartedly .
The , that is as is the result completely , this also our personal lifestyle and our relationship with the design .
Is important also think in the part the .
The , therefore , not only physically , but that also taken , example , of the pages of products in the weeklies ( of specific subjects , as trends , , coats , etc. ) .
Of all this we spoke the and leather Mario Kameník .
But all this already is for the Sunday .
The has of have a global vision .
The three invited specialists him the conference the Saturday with information on all kind of bodies .
The Honza Pokorný , the leather of fashionable Jakub Polanka and the of fashionable Ben Renč .
Jakub we reminded that fashionable is an illusion and the should from party to this .
And a good know work with a same of tight of various forms .
The is , in this case , fundamental .
So , the such ( or as say in English , trench-coat ) can tight to what hidden with and , but also it for tight the body he with shoes of and as if it in reality a clothing .
Or well enough and higher the bottleneck for obtain an image completely different .
&quot; Jugad with this &quot; , we stressed .
What that more is the next Council : &quot; for start to work , ago lack that first all the rules &quot; .
&quot; then already Now &quot; , said Jakub .
Por end I is clear what all these keep , what being with what , what , if then is that in the weeklies of fashionable we different results .
That about of the .
Thank the Ben , know a has that have more types of clothes in the reserve of the to .
So , for a history of fashionable that have ten pages ( therefore , ten ) , there that have splendid , lists for use , the least fifteen .
And also that photos the clothes works in combination with other , all them different to the mines in the reality .
All this there that times in account to the time of solutions the .
Honza Pokorný we was that image and the lifestyle excessive them alone , in many cases , the half the success .
Enough look to Madonna , that is not precisely a as extraordinary , but the image and the have fact of she a star World .
In keeping , the time , not there still a trend clear to use the services of the .
To the eventual famous also what are pointless ( I mere my skills , my physical aspect not has so importance ) .
And when someone we our services , there that have in account that is very likely that we a stature very different to the their real ( will ) .
Then only is and physically if the weeklies the heart already have writing on the issue , if a certain has / , etc.
The Sunday , Honza and Mario we in that not you enough in the fashionable , but that has that understand of .
For their work , on all must communicate with the people to the , what that is fundamental be a good Guillermo .
Know appreciate to the people , not ago of least , it their views .
&quot; when a there you for that you the and what with fine , not Now catch and throwing all what that had and say : &quot; what horror &quot; &quot; .
&quot; Encontrad the least a couple of things that and recommend for that someone the can to &quot; , says Mario .
He same also we was that all must in the call &quot; &quot; , is say , the exchange of work .
This set around of the and have there all the necessary tools .
Are items as nail , as nail , , or . there also balance of ( that you it the for the session of photos of such products that or ) , special of of front , if this outside greater ( the and another kind of not are , therefore could damage the fabric ) , or a at of remnant .
For not slogans in the usual and to something in practice , we learned to the of the shoes .
Even for the sessions of photos in the study , in a flat surface , could damage the and a more still the foreign .
And we not .ore that and .
Not we play the shoes with the nail for not accident .
So that had that be very .
Mario I has given a joy the who my work reserves .
The truth is that not I are very well these skills .
This is only a small part of all the we heard for all the end of week , in the second part the course .
Already I I given account that commit the to professional level is not a way of reflect , but I exactly as what that telling the people .
In Need at Speed : the Run competing whole America .
Dealt
A journey , in principle , complicates to cause of a series of of a journey routine for the Question of morning .
In certain measure managed cover the expectations , but this not it of nothing , if , in reality , not intended to nothing so .
The new over , to the title adds the Run , large adherents expectations already before of their .
Prometía that would new Buenos to the former of to Need at Speed and , to as of what shown , is as a at that not should end being other time a gender of action more .
Also we know how bee the scenes , where the like main falling the car and drunk their own ordinary .
As is happen in the of NFS , the results not vary great thing regard to what that we those .
There to that can to tonnage , but in the total some points to cause of failures absurd , that already come in the series since ago years .
In reality not can not blend errors , but that is more well of the incomprehensible of the .
The adventure starts very well .
Se you introduces in a history , whose leading , as , has certain personal problems ; for , you offers participate in a career illegal whole America .
You the in the at East , in St which , and excuses mission is to the first to new York .
The idea is offer something interesting .
The route into in ten stages and , then , in more of fifty to .
Of this follows that every career has place a route different and the stages are in different forestry , that are quite various and interesting .
Of that way , one not has not the of that at will always what same .
Some of the forestry are even to the view , although the technical level the is equivalent the of previous evidence of the series .
Por therefore , is not nothing the another world .
But the walk the desert , the landscape or the high mountains covered of snow is an effect about very a .
Also , the to of time in when an element .
So , example , in the desert you a storm of bit that ever the visibility .
In change , in the mountains there that have care for that not you a .
According that , every a of the to is very well developed .
Only there a couple of models , but with that enough .
For a time , to an amount of rival ( what normal in a classical career ) , after of earn time ( duel hidden ) and then you expected a duel against a only .
In a of all this is to sometimes the police , that not ago but obstruct still more the things .
The element are the landscape outside the car .
Se have when as , in the majority of the cases , has of escape of someone and fine you that , always the fair in the time fair .
Nothing complicated .
Is surprising , however , that has enough least landscape in the at of what that be wait ( in particular there only three ) .
But the result end is positive , because this element not a to be upsetting and , in the context already mentioned , is one of the elements that do that at it more interesting .
The model of underlined still the fingerprinting of the previous episodes .
That to say that to day of today already not be great thing , but not can that be bad .
If a realistic , already Now to in other part .
But to a career by with quite action you be quite this lifestyle of underlined , although we find something better between the games of the competition .
To here , all in order .
But the problems arise after of a true time .
To difference of what right of the models of underlined , already not happens what same with the collisions .
Of games of this kind is not wait that and collisions complicated , but of fact before of a coup against any subject , not Now predict how prosecution , with what which not all is in order .
Is typical the to a very or able the prosecution with a traffic normal , so only has covered , but in other situations almost identical , prosecution has doing .
Or even has completely destroyed .
Thank the system of , not arise large problems , but can of humour .
The are of such way that , when an accident or you of the back , the at you the last point of rescue in the back .
Sin however , in every career only at of five available .
If the all , you that restart the career since the principle .
So therefore is not more an aid in case of that something not will well , but is not very of .
To sometimes , not the aid , only aid the stage on of memory .
A great disadvantage the at is that ourselves facts are in different places .
In some , example , there that into of a way specific ; of another way , are being of take .
Other sometimes you in some website vehicles &quot; civilians &quot; always with the same configuration , although the first , or five minutes before or after .
This ago of on all in situations , when that two that will the i in directions diametrically , your problems , but when , or well ruthless .
Is as when , because is programmed that &quot; surprise &quot; always will front of release .
The adversaries have also an advantage more .
For whole the starting to websites where , have in account the time , always you the same in the same website .
Also this happens the end of the starting , in a long bridge , what which is still more .
Vuestro must to before that fine , the price that be .
When is front of fine , you difficult the vision of the come of with , so that principle Now to the car .
Se can understand the idea of create a at with maximum takes of and , but the execution is so apparent that surely you delay .
And is a it , because although the model the journey be simple , the at is fun and with action , of way that to often is not possible to the detail what that is not where .
And really as , if the merit has the idea with fifty runs standardise or the classification in the career for that not the platitude , or any other thing .
An idea is the change of for the to .
You that be to to the of petrol the on of the road , because exactly there you that change of prosecution , although in the great majority of the cases you suffice what that you .
The into in three categories .
The sports are suitable for areas urban , the strong Americans for the motorways and the for a underlined technical , example , roads of mountain with .
Also balance main also is a balance of challenges parallel , is say , there to in specific places that stories .
Here not only rich , but also points of experience for profile , that it therefore for the challenges as the .
The achieve the level higher , the driver you open several for , beginning the prosecution and with funds for the profile .
The same time , there a role Autolog in line , that highlights results with the of other players and other duties Community .
One of the elements more difficult of understand is how is nation the last career in the history .
With the car to the tunnel the metre ( pass ) , where you to to to shameful the to ( pass ) .
The you mark between 150 and 200 km / h ( pass ) and , of suddenly , behind you a metre and you has front more .
In the wording surely we a discussion on this for several days , on if for the programming the at none was even a little or if the authors of truth we take a bunch of .
The technical part the at is not nothing so , but the least the general effects are in the majority of the cases , to sometimes to .
Therefore what it that , in the at more reduces the quality of image and , in times , of a serious way .
This affects on all to the accidents where there many participants , when the quality of continual image already is not valid .
The audio is well and the bandwidth is a question of tastes .
To end of that be the welcome to the greater part the group youth , the bandwidth belongs to the category &quot; every one of their father and of their mother &quot; , but can mean that nobody enlightened the at only their music .
The end of Need at Speed : the Run is therefore quite confused .
If the at errors absolutely thinks , we problems in that Run is the better at of NFS of the last years .
Da the of that at is not completed .
The is , but because the errors you slap in the eyes with the force of a of airport .

The her to the EU , Vicenová :
The Czech have an ensure of and eurosceptics .
&quot; the Treaty of Lisbon has affected significantly the balance between the individual institutions &quot;
&quot; not I than a war Guardia &quot; .
&quot; estimating five , six years , before of that situation a little , and the new players to their new papers &quot; , so began with conviction their conference in the bioaccumulative of right the her Czech to the EU , Milena Vicenová .
How not factored in seriously their motto &quot; clear and openly on Europe &quot; , that said already in the first part of their conference , when managed under every body of the EU and their relations with such precision and clarity , therefore would the of many lecturers of the bioaccumulative of right of the U. Carolina .
Vicenová also the work of the new President permanent the Council European , Herman will Rompuy :
&quot; what first arise the criticisms , that if is , an official grey , capable of in any role , but I of say that he to all there , because moderating their gender to the mastered &quot; .
&quot; is a man that know listen to the Member of the bringing States , communicate with them and that has a vision of towards where must go the EU &quot; .
The new since of representative of the foreign policy and security it to from of the question : &quot; who is this EU ? to what number can ? &quot; . Se is therefore of a important step towards the unification and the clarification of of the Union policy of face to States as China or India .
Nobody to the cheese of Olomouc
Vicenová has occupied also of the agenda was , still and will the Council European in the future next .
The Presidency Czech of ago two years was a success .
The Czech Dublin of the economic crisis shining , worked the crisis the gas and organised a summit for the partnership Eastern .
The fall the government in at time lighthouse as an aspect very negative , that back seriously to keeping .
The representation Czech in the EU has the many time commitments .
In words of the her : &quot; a good mighty &quot; , not only the Presidency , but also the financial crisis , that is trying now .
Por another on , there that approve the budget for seven years of the EU , caused the current economic situation , a more difficult .
If the budget is more simple and effective , what sectors will priority , what countries will greater support and what least ? that is something that will present in the agenda of the next meeting .
The her reminded also their main , with the came to Europe : &quot; about of Europe with clarity &quot; .
&quot; what true is that not I them the or the people not understand &quot; .
&quot; how can a citizen understand that in Brussels not invent of truth the curvature the curvature or , bananas of various sizes or that nobody we is to ban the cheese of Olomouc ? &quot; .
Also to from more from the environment of the EU and closer to more Czech citizens to the European institutions .
We expected the Europe of the part
According the her , the Czech have reputation of eurosceptics and the people is more well the aspects negative that positive .
Also , the low participation of the Czech in the European institutions .
The fault is of a of factors , as the of our candidates , their inability for write messages of motivation , but also the little support of the Czech .
Also the success of the Presidency Czech , it of highlighted the force and the collaboration the group of Visegrad .
&quot; Créanme that when who to me a Polish and a Hungarian and I about a Slovak , a French to my on I says : &quot; what , already you been , the group of Visegrad ? &quot; , and is that not you ago no grace &quot; .
In the future , to the EU , according Vicenová , you new regulations of policy budgetary for the States Member .
Se is as something very real the concept of the two part , if not are more , in Europe , more that new of &quot; the Federation European &quot; .
&quot; we countries in the Eurozona and countries outside of the Eurozona &quot; .
&quot; we the space Schengen and we also the procedure of cooperation from &quot; .
&quot; Se said first time that only the countries that want and the not , that outside &quot; .
&quot; these procedures will every time more and reinforced the Europe of the two part &quot; , expected Vicenová .
In this sense , also skills the role of keeping and of Herman will Rompuy in the implementation the principle , according the which all the subjects that affect to the whole of the EU must discuss between the States Member , not only between the Member of the Eurozona .

As the own company says there a difference between into in the business and create directly a business .
Ibm - or the &quot; green great &quot; - as the known in the EE.UU. to cause of their logo , has become in the last hundred years in a of the over companies the world .
Is possibly the technological company more ( develops therefore equipment as programmes , infrastructure and services it website within of a wider range of services , that will since humble to ) .
Holds the greater number of patent of all the companies faith and five of their employees have received the Prize Peace .
Between their are the cash cash , the cards of payment , the financial , the codes of bars and the .
Ibm this year 220 billion million of dollars . this year has become in the second technological signing coverage of market ( the first is Apple ) , when overtook first time in 1996 to Microsoft .
Eye the future
Not all the products and bringing just of satisfy the will of the customers and the time ( IBM not their own operational system , you / 2 , services in line Prodigy or computers IBM PCjr ) .
&quot; if their business on in move , not can responding in the last &quot; , extended Samuel J. Palmisano .
Por that , IBM not has problems in build their foundation in other platforms ( and also , if not work , the or ) .
And this difference of the competition , Microsoft , that all in and you always exclusively with Windows .
Technology of future
In question of sales , IBM he on all to services , of the approximately a fifth part are of programmes and other fifth of equipment .
With all , still in 1990 the equipment represented more of the half of the share of the suppliers .
To from the year 2000 , IBM has sold active of under performance a value total of 15 billion million of dollars . for in the same period , has made 58 billion million of dollars in the buying of technology of future .
The investments have followed since 2008 , when first time manifested the modern financial crisis World .
Ibm it according the premises of their first head , he J. addressing , who for the great economic crisis the 29 increased the investments .
Seems that to now the company IBM has known the crisis .
The value of the actions of IBM since the beginning the year 2008 has grown to a 120 % , the benefit net of the company not has longer of increase .
The motto of IBM is all , unless their value .
Se can , therefore , wait that when bits the next crisis , this heralded flexible .

How have out the prices of the travel since 1989
To 1989 had in the Czechoslovakia of then only five agencies of travel state you : , Sporturist , CKM , Rekrea and Autoturist .
The agencies of travel of at time in the majority of the cases travel only the bloc Socialist , therefore the travel to West were very .
The tourists Czech would , therefore , of holiday to the beaches of the GDR ( democratic Republic German ) , to the Union Soviet , ( Sochi in Crimea in the sea black ) to Bulgaria and Romania ( both in the sea black ) and to Hungary ( Balaton ) .
An positive exception was the period for between 1962 and 1972 , when could travel to Yugoslavia , however , after the regime towards the East and the travel of the tourists Czech were then quite .
A great somewhat the socialism was the fact that to the citizens the bloc Socialist ( or be , also to the Checoeslovacos ) not them travel free and dreaming not even the countries socialists .
If a citizen wanted travel dreaming , example , to Poland or to the Union Soviet , needed a letter of invitation , if not , the individual journey not was possible .
The agencies of journey in those times also travel the East , but one should to to the EU with a together of ball and to so whole the night , or have &quot; good known &quot; in the agency .
Still so not all was cattle .
The call &quot; promise of change &quot; that was the condition for the travel the East , not to the &quot; people politically little reliable &quot; , that so not could travel in no .
The currency not was a currency freely converted and , guarantee of change , not was possible obtain the resources ( the currency Western ) for travel to West .
The great majority of the Czech experience their holiday in their own country , what that had a great number of bonemeal and houses of summer , that Czech . this preparation still there .
The way of travel of the Czech has suffered since 1989 a real revolution .
While that to 1989 for us was the is not more to the holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria , the last year the Czech did 4.5 million of travel of holiday to countries of all the world .
Is great somewhat , of the today day already we not .ware , the fact of that destination currently bookmakers , Croatia , to 1989 not could travel freely , because was part of the Yugoslavia of then .
To principles of the years 90 imposed the exemption of visa for travel to the States neighbours of Europe Western , what that resulted a huge wave of visits of short a , to Vienna or Germany .
The , for a time , not his of the East , all the world wanted it the what least a time .
Por example , in Paris the groups of Czech in the parks in shops of campaign , already that our income of then we not .ay a hotel or pension .
A typical feature of the Czech of at time was the be for the food ( canned , pressed , etc. ) for save .
Another important time was the introduction of the of the crown Czech , so our tourists could finally , after of decades , buy freely currency Western .
Our level of life and with he also the wages media , what that around of 1997 resulted an increase in the demand of travel .
With the increase of the demand of travel they the agencies , to from of 1997 with regularly , to preparation the travel using the colleges of flights , what that was down incredibly the prices of the travel in compared with the last , thank to the possibility of obtain discounting the volume of passengers .
To end of the 90 the last century , already the Czech found visa to almost all the countries developed , are EE.UU. , what which still more our travel .
Another time interesting in the history the tourism pos-revolucionario happened already in the 2000 , when was organised , thank to a huge demand , the first flight direct since keeping to a country , and was to Thailand .
Since at year , proceed all the years flights direct with tourists Czech was distant countries and . this winter already directly since keeping to 12 destinations .
The countries the their currently close of 100 billion Czech the year .
Another time interesting of this time , that symbolises our development pos-revolucionario , came in the year 2008 .
The 17 of November of 2008 , EE.UU. squeezed the visa for the tourists Czech , with what that our country happened to be between the countries more developed the world .
In 2008 the Czech , first time in their history , have last more of the half of their holiday in the abroad ( 50.3 % ) and first time in their history , have ecu in travel the abroad more of 15 billion billion Czech head , including the expenditure in the website of stay .
Tandare general House ordinary for choose the President , that could end of new in point died .
Since ago almost five months the football Czech is President and is likely that successor of Safronov Hašek as President of the Federation Czech of Futbol ( FAČR ) , not after the call of the next House general extraordinary that will place this Thursday in Nymburk .
Of fact , still not has come to an agreement on the rules of vote to to .
Sin the same , not will vote even for choose between the three candidates .
The interested to the football Czech are Jindřich Rajchl , Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík .
Hašek to their office in June not before convene to their colleagues with the purpose of find a person strong that deals the football in the future .
Sin however , after of conclude the was Hašek , used a controversy between the two of the partnership unable of to to an agreement for decisions a candidate common .
This became in obvious the 16 of September when had that be elected the new President .
The delegates of the House general met in vain in the home national ( Národní ) , on in the area of Smíchov , because the discussions had blocked and not only in as the method of election .
Not came to no consensus not in as to who in the general House had right to vote - only the legal representatives or also the delegates with a powers .
To from of that time and because to this only point , in an agreement over , supported also the recommendation the Institute of state and right , according the which the representation a powers is not possible .
Sin however , the disputes on the electoral code are open .
More light on the situation already not could should not the Committee executive that , in their meetings , or extraordinary , all not Preah nothing .
The opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a couple of sometimes already , but the point nerve still being the same .
The question is the next : of what way to in the third round for avoid the point died ?
&quot; the dispute this in about to if must to of agreement with the or find another model &quot; , says Dušan Svoboda , one of the three of the FAČR , since the direction of the partnership , represents the professional .
According the model proposed in the , in the third round going at candidate that have greater percentage of support in the Federation to the which will their candidacy .
The region of CZK is ready to to to a compromise for that can earn at candidate with a greater percentage total of votes in both .
The part Bohemia , however , which the condition of that winner , according these are , should have the majority of the least two thirds .
&quot; this you , however , the sense to the two previous rounds and completely the concept of system &quot; , so is as Svoboda understand the concerns of the part , according what which what better would not play the order and vote according the files .
With what said , surprisingly , is of agreement also Tomaš Paclík , although is that regulation electoral established the of all the candidates be more to Pelta .
&quot; I like that maximum of agreement with the &quot; .
&quot; for that not no about of the representatives as in the last general House &quot; , says the you of victory Plzen , that first time as candidate and that at their comments mainly in against of Pelta .
Pelta still being positive .
According he , in Nymburk decide on the new President and he believes that candidates in the future of constructive way .
&quot; all the with the party of today of our national team in the championship European .
&quot; the football will to be leading , and so more to will &quot; says the representative the Jablonice , that of the three candidates has more experience in management the football , therefore to level professional as regional .
Rajchl is the more reluctant .
&quot; hope that it to an agreement , but , unfortunately , the situation is a more difficult . &quot;
&quot; is not the conflict between and , but there attempts of the rules to their own convenience . &quot;
&quot; this can have as result a new deadlock of the general House . &quot;
&quot; of all case , hope that band the common sense &quot; , said Rajchl .
Already is not a time for that all the parties are to an agreement .
Some negotiations had that take in Montenegro , but who can know to that start the party if the team of football will completely ?
The special air , in the had that travel to Podgorica , between other the Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl , not has out this morning technical problems in Prague , taking that other an alternative for carry to part the Committee executive the place where will place the party of classification .
Quizas the decisive meeting , end , could be the will place to level ministerial , according have , will this Wednesday .
To Josef Dobeš , Minister of education , young and sports , you like an integrate to the parties divided to the organisation integrating more powerful the country for that it to an agreement .
There a in at : the benefits state , the credibility the football and also the next general House the Committee Central of the Federation the sport ( ) that awareness made of a new direction the sport Czech after the financial problems of the home of Sazka .
Paclík achieve the Presidency , because is not a candidate more appropriate .
If the head of the of Pilsen , Tomaš Paclik , before of the House general extraordinary the name of a candidate appropriate that all their ideas on the new President of the Federation Czech of football ( FAČR ) , not would as candidate to a since so relevant .
&quot; if would a person appropriate , would fighting she and not I would as candidate to the elections . &quot;
&quot; but to the day of today not has been find a person so &quot; , said Paclík for the agency of news Czech ( )
What that justifies to Paclík to into in the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of block to Pelta , the course winner of the elections , that opens the way to the Presidency of the Federation Czech of Futbol ( FAČR ) .
Paclík also that , in case through , in the office of President only to 2013 , when ground the Question of the House general ordinary .
In that office you like see to an expert and good workforce that is not too related with the events fans .
&quot; already I about with some people to the could have in account &quot; .
&quot; for me was a madness hear to some say that in this time not even want identify with the football Czech . &quot;
&quot; I like change that vision &quot; , adds .
What that supposed more bother to Paclík in this time is the relationship of Pelta with the President of the partnership of football regional of Pilsen Polanski Berbr , a man with a last controversial , known outside the as a with capacity of influence in the vote of the delegates in the House general .
For Paclík is so unacceptable see to Pelta at in the presidential .
&quot; in case of that , Nazarbayev the status existing and nothing in the football will &quot; .
&quot; with the support of Berbra , a man of business ambitious , the football sorry still least from &quot; , said Paclík .
Mentions also the fact of that ago a years the name of Pelta was related with a usual telephone for the research of a case of corruption , of the which Pelta went .
&quot; not know what prestige the football could bring the victory of Pelta . &quot;
&quot; and with what eyes we All the UEFA and the FIFA &quot; , said Paclík , that also the with certain caution their statement previous that &quot; the club Pilsen if Pelta become in President &quot; .
In the case of earn the elections the Thursday , Paclík could be the cooperation with Pelta in the future .
Of same opinion is the another candidate , Rajchl , that has been supported Paclík before of the House general of September that end in a .
&quot; he ( Pelta ) would the first the solitary &quot; .
&quot; is very capable . &quot;
&quot; I what could imagine , example , as head of the representation &quot; .
&quot; but not as workforce of a partnership &quot; .
&quot; I not the there where not I am capable &quot; , added Paclík , that in September very attention support the from of the Commission of Ludek Macel , potential after Dagmar Damkova .
Paclík accepts that to manage the partnership .
Particularly to their capacities of management of the private companies , therefore since the last summer is also the director the Pilsen , that with their support took in May the in first division .
&quot; have force for change some things in the area of football and make to their practice safe . &quot;
&quot; for reduce the influence of some groups of pressure , that probably tend to influence in the decisions the Committee refunded and of appeal , have situations unpleasant , said Paclík so their towards the President the Sparta Daniel Křetínský .
A of the priorities also would the of consolidate the relationship between the FAČR and the Committee Olímpico Czech , with the aid the which pressure on the leaders political for that Socrates more money the sport of the tax of the I .
&quot; is one of the problems key the should conducting the new President . &quot;
&quot; if the tax on the games of gambling , as what the political parties , support their arguments , but , frankly , have that us where is to stop all this money &quot; , out .
Ademas , Paclík now not has in account even their partnership with the club Pilsner , although he same says that President of the FAČR must be &quot; not she &quot; .
Pelta is to their time related with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague .
&quot; is not ideal . &quot;
&quot; but not see sense the fact of yield preach my actions the club of Pilsen to other person for then again there after a year and a &quot; , said Paclík .
Pelta promised to the FAČR new that with the point died of the elections .
Two days before of the House general of the partnership of football one of the candidates to the Presidency , Miroslav Pelt , promised that , in case of be elected , coordinating that FAČR had a new that definitely for right , in the future , the controversy in as the regulation electoral .
The representative the Jablonec is positive in as to the meeting of this Thursday in Nymburk , and believes that conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory the team of football .
Already before of the elections not made in September , Pelta promised firstly , in case of be elected , precisely in the representation and in custom funds .
Decided participate in the last minute in the last general House , what that be of two months you could go well for defend and it , in a context more broader , their ideas on the management the football .
&quot; the people of all the levels taken the football already ago a time and expected know this Thursday the new President . &quot;
&quot; feel that has come the time of that someone the partnership &quot; , think the man that couples mainly with the club of Jablonice , but that worked in the Sparta and in the Committee executive of the partnership .
Por this reason , believes have enough experience for manage the football Czech .
Is convinced that behind of the problems current with the elections is the euphoria that hung in the time of Safronov Hašek .
&quot; unfortunately , in the general House of June were adopted the not were so planned as all thought . &quot;
&quot; if certain interpretations , we a President already since September &quot; , warned Pelta .
Exactly the document more important of the partnership aids as for who to the delegates .
&quot; if I President , I what counts as a personal challenge and am now to to in case of that . &quot;
&quot; is a question of principles , the which we not .here &quot; , says Pelta .
Also , in theory , is not over with their opponents .
Already in the last had your that was mercy with Henry Rajchl , the respects their training in right , being aware of that their would also their first of .
Already was a time attack to he Paclík who , the contrary of Pelta , not he pawn with head .
&quot; has more of a year in the world of football , and already has achieved some successes . &quot;
&quot; their attacks but were and very people became amazed the electoral campaign . &quot;
&quot; Por that many of them on their real nature &quot; , said to their Maracaibo Pelta , that still being faithful to the statements announced already in September .
Their weapon more powerful is , according he , their knowledge the football , since the sports more in to the with .
This last should be of promotion the football .
&quot; also , right all the arose to cause of the Bohemians as result the scandal of corruption the last year . &quot;
&quot; immediately after I in the negotiations with the sector public and the private , for ensure that has enough money for all the football &quot; , said ago two months to the candidate of 46 years .
To continuation also promised that their appointment as President the football not no personal change of the .
&quot; would that know first the tasks of every he &quot; , said she to Strahov where , after a long period of , has a comprehensible .
To despite of the scenarios current doomsday that to the next general House , he believes that delegates not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk .
&quot; if the only point of disagreement will how vote in the third round , doubt what we overcome .
&quot; the football needs credibility , the which will only if end has a leader &quot; , still two days before of the working more decisive in their career of representative , Pelta still being positive .
Rajchl equally , that under their leadership , the FAČR to work with wish .
If in the quarter general House its elected the current of Jindrich Rajchl as new President of the partnership of football Czech , very people remuneration surely .
Rajchl equally that , in case of be elected , hard .
To implement a systematic change and to that Member the Committee executive are responsible of every area the football dreaming .
Also compromises to resolve the case of the Bohemians , improve the relations with the UEFA and the FIFA , to more money for the football and continue with the work on the previous President Safronov Hašek .
&quot; as President , I like commit completely the football &quot; .
&quot; since the international contacts with the UEFA and the FIFA to the selection , happening the professional football or the invariably of young of high performance . &quot;
&quot; with this not i say that what would all only &quot; , said Rajchl in an interview for the .
&quot; am a player of team and i gentleman the powers the Committee executive of such way that every Member can their to an area taxation . &quot;
&quot; and tasks difficult for that football can , in every one of these , to forward with a momentum &quot; .
&quot; to very people this probably not you , because busies start to work very hard and not only criticise the work of the others &quot; , added .
Because to the atmosphere of criticism in the movement , says that has have the possibility of not stand of new as candidate .
&quot; all know , that work 20 hours joys . &quot;
&quot; but need know that will sense and that not will people behind of my that I – and to every step &quot; , he so the for of their .
&quot; very people I has said that not I asked Source , because then Choice also the others &quot; .
&quot; Se is of have faith for not leave so , more &quot; , said .
According say , you justifies also continue the work that already began with Hašek .
&quot; for these two years , end a great part the work that not i that now vanish &quot; .
&quot; there processes that had started and that will their effect within of a couple of years and not I like that someone the &quot; , announced concerned the fact of that , if the another candidate , Miroslav Pelta , the situation in the partnership could again to be such as was before of the time of Hašek .
&quot; I i in the order , and is something that , in my opinion , Mirek Pelta is not capable of keep .
&quot; behind of he is on all whole that people that football for that outside only a privileged for a few elected . &quot;
&quot; Se I can a lot of things , but not the fact of that am to favour of someone . &quot;
&quot; attempt be aim . &quot;
&quot; i to a football for all , because only so well all and not only the elected &quot; , said Rajchl .
This also the idea that only serious resort the President .
&quot; although some people seeking that what contrary , have in mind to what maximum CZK . &quot;
&quot; Por example , is time of think in the fact of gentleman the second division in a part Czech and in other , whose winners to the first division &quot; .
&quot; not would the current situation in the we only three equipment of CZK , what that represents a problem for the young players &quot; , said Rajchl .
Although to the of the elections presidential Tomaš Paclík , President the club Pilsner , Rajchl is not of believe in their for of be elected .
&quot; still am have a strong support of the Federation Czech , the which I was as their of and that know that behind of me there successes clear &quot; , said Rajchl , whose successes understand the savings of a tens of million of billion of contracts , the negotiations of contracts and the negotiations on the law of the I .
Por another on , recognised their part of fault in that Federation is not united .
And while civilized that Pelta is &quot; for to the confidence in the football Czech &quot; , as the another contravention , Paclík , as a candidate strong that has something that offer the football .
&quot; nobody can for that was a great work the Pilsen at year &quot; .
&quot; in the case of that be elected , probably will what that already began Safronov Hašek and not of way significantly the personal in the committees . &quot;
&quot; not i use that to my favour &quot; , so to their rival Rajchl .

The home 21 in Vienna
The made
Por Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and an end happy , the of the statement Austrian universal of Brussels of 1958 successful awarding , was in Vienna for a Museum , became we and .
Now as home of exhibitions .
The architecture of modern , the forms clear , the of glass , the and the new materials of construction , classic the thinking on the technical progress , for what the architect Karl Schwanzer for the statement universal of Brussels of 1958 is an example appropriate and known .
The of successful Schwanzer then the Grand Prix of architecture their this and floating construction of steel and glass .
The construction as to the today a milestone contemporary of the architecture .
Was the architect so known that also was the of Austria in the next statement universal .
With their tower of four for MBW more the building in Munich , happened to be globally known .
Their a , designed as a construction temporary for exhibitions after of the statement universal in the Schweizer Garten with to the station the southern of Vienna , in 1962 and within kind a Museum the century 20 , phoned the &quot; home 20 &quot; .
The building was appropriate but of the areas and suitable technology for a Museum ; no wall for art , not a good environment .
To despite of this used to that contemporary art in Vienna had a new home .
The building is we since 2001 and every time more .
Currently , the architect Adolf Krischanitz the , now what is &quot; home 21 &quot; and in the future as Museum of contemporary art .
The Tuesday the later kind the Museum , the belongs the home , with the first statement , a coup of fortunately in true way .
Agnes Husslein-Arco , the new there of the gallery Austrian since 2007 , in a new start .
Husslein-arco , in history the art with a considerable career , between other things , artistic on ice in their young , more later in Sotheby , the Museum Guggenheim and there the Museum of art modern of Salzburgo , was the reforms with the insistence of political and protectors of the monuments , public funds and private and set their use .
To exception the art contemporary , deviant the works the Fritz Wotruba of the foundation , should have a cafeteria and an and also built a building of offices .
Control narrower , budget under
Krischanitz was the better election for do .
Not only because of sensitive way the Secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna , what and you the , if not because with Schwanzwer in the technical University of Vienna and the was for he a &quot; important place and in &quot; , in the &quot; almost all the for of week &quot; the exhibitions .
Was the project and the problem the building , that with with their it to Vienna in their change of use with generosity and easily .
In the current reforms there large problems , the building was &quot; a of energy &quot; , said Krischanitz .
Se changed the profile of the windows of the on of glass , a glass reinforced with very of glass and the homeless of glass a glass of special security .
The bridges and the of steel or and the ceilings of .
Two pictures for the new use , a panel of light fallen between the home and the street provided a bridge it for into the building almost new , but still the of Schwanzer .
A doors original Foreign , the home is in old subscribe and against the .
And the room of cinema is exactly as was before .
And all this with a control narrower part of the office of monuments and a under budget .
&quot; to often had that find material that outside good , cheap and also did to the office of protection of monuments &quot; , says Krischanitz and on of a soil in the .
To despite of all the pressure , problems and reforms , the building in flexible and superfluous .
What the &quot; that wine of Brussels &quot; has been difficult , said ago little Krischanitz , a typical &quot; emergence accidental in the history of the city &quot; .
An architecture so is &quot; always in the wrong place &quot; and that wanted &quot; certainly the awareness appropriate &quot; .
In this case the home 21 is not in the wrong place , has happened a coup of fortunately . the completely new and &quot; area of the station Central &quot; , with housing and offices , is with the Schweizer Garten .
And such time take another coup of fortunately : the home 21 could receive a forward of other construction of Krischanitz , therefore the Francesca von Habsburg has purchased the room of temporary art and , as as , negotiate with the city on a place neighbour in the Schweizer Garten .

The concrete threat
After the discovery of &quot; the cell of Zwickau &quot; , the media of communication Turks the state of right German .
A newspaper about of a &quot; ideology bloody &quot; that again to .
The for of eight small employers noticed and Greeks between the years 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right .
In Turkey and in the population German of origin Turkish has reacted with fear and concern to this news .
For many Germans of origin Turkish which a that thought died ago time , since the attacks with way of fires in Mölln in November of 1992 and in Solingen in May of 1993 , not had happened more episodes of violence with background of extreme right against Turks .
Not however , never has questioned that in Germany there xenophobia .
The network lb reveals a scale whose dimensions not were , not a least , .
&quot; again to the ideology bloody ? &quot; , the edition Internet the newspaper Turkish &quot; Haberturk &quot; .
The newspaper &quot; Sabah &quot; the contrary that one of the authors the crime was a – of the office Federal of defence of the constitution and shows concerned that authorities German can be involved in the .
The Community Turkish in Germany with , the end of week reminded to the victims of the violence racist with a to the door of Brandenburgo .
Two weeks before , the Community Turkish in Berlin with with the political Germans and Turks in an act formal the fifty anniversary the agreement turco-alemán .
The them it in scene with much colours , as a history with end happy .
The information came to some media Turks as a : &quot; the gift German the fifty anniversary &quot; , says the title of a Article in the platform Turkish of Internet &quot; have X &quot; , she the background of the chain of for .
The emission German &quot; Hürriyet &quot; not should in out this connection mental .
&quot; beginning to nostrils &quot; , says the title of the spine of Ahmet Külahci .
Resalta that killed were people that their tax and did an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany .
In the body of Internet of Germans of Turkish , the behaviour of the police and their of success in the is very accept .
The authors of that authorities German not have a before suspected in the proving of the .
One shows as least rhetorical in as to the media : &quot; to from of now here lose , to the immigrants not them is more that is and the arms &quot; .
&quot; this will the better &quot; .
&quot; the internal peace of Germany on are of the quality of the perverse and of the adequacy of the penalty to whole the network &quot; . , says &quot; Selen &quot; .
What that means that , if the peace internal of Germany is in danger , the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in nineties years .
The image of the ruins the fire of Solingen has incident in the transported German and Turkish .
No another basin was more clearly to the Turks that live here that there a concrete threat and , to the Germans , that mistrust and the distance can in the violence .
The attacks the sense of group of the part Turkish .
Not repeat the errors the last
In the press Turkish reputed then mainly the swathes of the policy German after the attacks , Helmut Kohl denies to visiting to the survivors of Mölln .
After the attack with way of fire of Solingen sent a of condolences the President Turkish and Klaus Kinkel , their Minister of Affairs Foreign , what in the of colony . Kinkel in their speech what that contribute with the tax the Turks of Germany .
Is clear how estimated the value of a person according the amount of their tax .
The current information of the media Turks again to show what thorough that is , since then , the mistrust of many Germans of origin Turkish in the legality of this country .
Also the effort of an explanation wider and of a terrorism of extreme right in Germany , this time do lack words .
The Bank the scandal the shores of Zurich
The Bank more of Europe is not in Italy not France , if not in Switzerland .
The UBS almost been in in the financial crisis and since then of a crisis to the next .
Now the at a German .
Sure that Axel charisma not what had thought .
After of their witnessed starting of the summit the Bank Federal , in July through that in 2013 in a new and almost also of witnessed work : President the administrative Council the great Bank Swiss UBS , an and state step in their career .
Axel charisma am should , commends Switzerland their beauty and to the UBS their would acquired strength and is we comments on their future colleagues .
&quot; the transported has achieved a revival &quot; .
&quot; I am cooperate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel &quot; .
In September became clear that all would completely different .
A for financial of the transported in London blackout all the systems of security the Bank and 1.7 billion million of EUR .
Oswald Grübel , director general of the transported , a banker not only known in Switzerland , had that come .
The President the administrative Council of the transported was since then also , and all filed : when a Axel charisma ?
Se through that charisma must advise the Bank since February of 2012 .
And will office of the Presidency the administrative Council in May , not to principles of 2013 , as the Bank the Tuesday .
This is hard for Axel charisma .
Not is banker , more well , Professor of economy and and has had a period of Globalisation surely necessary .
Of coup ago responsible of the strategy of a Bank , that has of again to prove that deserves the title &quot; the greater Bank the scandal of Europe &quot; since ago time .
Por a part , the transported is huge , to ago little was the greater administrator of goods World , and other part , since ago years , of a scandal the next .
Nothing , so what seems , you the changed so proud Bank Swiss .
Started the financial crisis .
The transported had a reputation excellent to 2007 .
The image the administrator of goods Swiss and hardest , but also , with ambitious objectives , also wanted be a great number in the banks of investments .
Por a part , with 1.6 billion of dollars , the transported variety more money of customers wealthiest that any another Bank the world .
And other part , as Bank of investments in the League of the large banks the world .
This .
Hans Geiger , the former banker and of Professor of in Zurich for many years it : &quot; to my students , always I described to the transported as model of a good Bank . &quot;
&quot; since the point of current view , one question : how could ? &quot;
Was in a great mistake .
In the year 2007 went to the light that something went very in the transported .
To in of year , Peter Wuffli , general director , that to then was have as a banker and very intelligent , resigned surprisingly .
Some months after , the reason .
The Fund of investments the Bank in losses with titles of high risk and had that thousands of million .
For should with the transported announced a of capital of nothing least that of 13 billion million of FRF .
For this found investors , course that some with contemptuous to little before : a Fund Asian state and of Singapore and a Fund state Arab , so , that never had heard their name .
This was only the first coup .
In April of 2008 , .
The Bank had that on the loss of thousands of million , Marcel Ospel , President the administrative Council , in 2006 in the second better paid administrative Council of Switzerland , resigned .
In October of 2008 , she the disaster , in view of their wrong investments , the UBS found in the financial crisis to the collapse and had that be the state .
The Bank national values problem to the UBS many thousands of million , the Confederation Helvética was six thousands of million of FRF a sensible converted , by the in the Bank .
Whole Switzerland was affected , said what dramatic that was this for a small country , if to banks so large .
Finally the sum the balance of the UBS in 2007 was more of five sometimes greater that economic results of Switzerland ( see ) .
&quot; we not .gain to beast to the UBS &quot; , said Geiger , expert in .
To the first disaster joined the second .
Few months after , the UBS in a conflict tax with America and was ready to limits the data of the customers wealthiest , that possibly had tax with aid the Bank .
Also , whereby a figure of 780 thousands of million of dollars , point of profits of these business with a compensation payment .
With the UBS more or least have helped in the fraud tax .
Vet lost something that had been since always their capital in the competition customers rich : the of discretion .
After the scandal , the secret the Bank Swiss already is not the same .
To this continued the Captain the President of the junta directive and the President the administrative Council .
And the displacement of the funds of the customers .
Of this way , in few months the Bank lost their credibility in their two central sectors : in the of investments by the speculation flawed and in the administration of goods by the aid the fraud tax .
And fair when readjust to be something more relaxed , fair when i that UBS readjust to this , is this history the for , a for individual 1.7 billion million of EUR , before of that Bank account of that something was .
And , what seen , this still not works well with the management of risk in the of investments .
&quot; with the case Adoboli to that controls of risk have changed too little &quot; , says Martin Janssen , Professor of economy and finance in the Institute banking of the University of Zurich .
The financial director of a great Bank German also is sure : &quot; the problem of the UBS is that not dominates the controls of risk &quot; .
Por what that about the idea of the caution , with the bankers Swiss were since ago time , be the watch of the over goods the world : no risk too large , in change , the security the money to the another on of the Republic Alpine .
The brains of security of the banks Swiss were the symbol of the reliability , as Lindt and Sprüngli the chocolate genuine .
The Central of the UBS in Zurich not Combating with the buzz the hardest private Bank Swiss , only is a little greater .
The situation is classical .
The Bank has their headquarters main in the street Bahnhofstraße of Zurich , that is since the station main directly the shores of Zurich , the summits covered of snow of the mountains .
Here the buildings are , the sells are a of the more higher of Europe .
Here are as Tiffany`s between business traditional Swiss as the Sprüngli .
Here they since ago years the banks Swiss : since the Bank national , happening the Palacio of Credit Suisse , to the banks private as Julius Bär .
Se will in the room of reception of the UBS by a disproportionately door chair .
Within the walls are of , front are large of such , with the logo the Bank there a great for indicate the &quot; security &quot; .
The UBS know what that client search here : security .
The two large banks Swiss , the UBS and Credit Suisse , in some time have the idea the great Bank Swiss , or the have betrayed , as view the President of a small private Bank Swiss .
Prefer not read their name in the newspaper , the end and the out ago , as all the bankers Swiss , also with the business of both large banks .
The UBS has fact too large , view , mainly in the of investments , where the Continental have cattle ground .
There the Swiss not had nothing more that say .
&quot; and have have for a time to the our of the Continental . &quot;
Of fact , the UBS changed the of investments with , handed their first great proposed and then wine the disaster , no financial European entity had lost therefore money in the high risk as the great Bank Swiss .
The 15 of October of 2008 , the disaster was clear .
&quot; that Wednesday the coalition government the small country of seven million decided the greater operation of rescue in the history of their nation &quot; , says the author Lukas Hässig in their book &quot; Wever UBS-Crash &quot; ( &quot; the of the UBS &quot; in Spanish ) .
The political granted to 68 thousands of million of FRF or approximately 45 thousands of million of EUR for save the great Bank of the .
How them happens ?
Se about with the bankers Swiss , so are the problem in the dimension of the UBS .
In June of 1998 , two of the three large banks Swiss in a consortium .
From a Bank that , because to the merger , was too large for the small Switzerland , and still growing .
Por what that was for that two different banks precursors of the UBS : a Bank Puerto but asserts with the centre of the administration of goods in Zurich and a more poor but more strong .
Of suddenly , the banks of investment came of way have with a money , with the could to a great financial bicycle .
There two names related with this takes of the UBS : Peter Wuffli , head the consortium of the UBS of 2001 to 2007 , and Marcel Ospel , then President the administrative Council .
&quot; always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a team perfect &quot; , says the expert in Hans Geiger .
&quot; Wuffli , the intellectual , modest , that understand a of models and statistics , and Ospel , the managed showed step since the learning in the Bank to the summit . &quot;
Finally , Ospel of Wuffli .
And the end Wuffli was probably a decisive mistake : &quot; was that their models were a reality &quot; , says Geiger .
&quot; is a case tragic . &quot;

Is clear : the came before the case .
The employees of the UBS remember clearly of the meetings of analysts , in the Wuffli , the head the consortium , always the same motto : down the seat to sink Sachs .

Some steps you forthcoming well .

Sin however , the net of companies makers put of highlighted a point weak : in the business the international interest , in the language of &quot; &quot; , there a huge compensation for the large banks .
The UBS has in the products Americans .
For fill these , the UBS started an adventure that almost you costs their existence .
Of growth , therefore the same Bank as one of their funds of high risk created in American investments of high risk .
Se transformed in a powerful machine for appropriations Americans and to continuation , certain risks to account own .
And also , as other banks at the for a time .
&quot; in summer of 2007 , as the market American estate was in , the UBS there &quot; , said Geiger , expert in .
So large the euphoria , so thorough the fall .
A workforce had that go , already that attempt of one s more complicated of what that were .
The jobs in the UBS became in seats and are to the today .
Currently , who at a great Bank , has a work almost impossible .
Must find a strategy for a Bank , to the all the models of business are stumbling .
Geiger , expert in banks , has an idea , to end to the of investments , focus in the administration of goods , return to the roots .
The Bank not to to so far ( still ) .
But the of investments must decrease a , is clear currently .
The next Thursday , Sergio Ermotti , the new President the Bank , will their future strategy the world .
In reality , only was in the italiano-suizo of 51 years as a solution Objective , already that Bank the Bank surprisingly of their predecessor Grübel .
Meantime , he imposed : must you of way permanent the business of the UBS , the Bank of Zurich the Tuesday .
Ermotti to restore the Bank of investment to their state to in of the nineties .
Makes 3.500 jobs .
But this not enough .
The UBS needs a vision .
Who is ?
With what to earn money ?
These are the questions that sure ago Axel charisma currently .
To the time only says that first a housing with their woman in Zurich .
The next year .

Massacre to level personal
The nostrils and generous new book of Peter Englund , the beauty and the pain of the battle ( the Beauty and the Sorrow ) : a history about of the first war World , &quot; beginning with a long the kind that can to that to one you the soul to the feet .
I here some by of action : testing this indeed and in their mark pages .
Will to know very well to these people in the mr Englund , and this will as their GPS , a for these few at in the , as one of their men and women , is confusing and in the fog of the war .
The mr Englund is a I and journalist Swedish .
Also is the new Secretary permanent of the Academy Swedish , that granted the Prize Peace of literature .
What that has writing here is a book little aware , that describes , rightly , as &quot; a work of anti-historia &quot; .
Contains some names triumphs , important treaties or famous battles ; virtually not there ambassadors , elegant journalists or further on holdings or material .
Not is therefore a book about of what happened , it , as &quot; a book about of how happened &quot; . is about of &quot; feelings , from , experiences and States of humour &quot; .
&quot; the beauty and the pain of the battle &quot; being the experiences in times of war of more or least 20 men and women , to both both of the war , since and to , doctors , drivers of Dmitri and administrative .
Some of these people in heroes .
Some in prisoners of war , or than their Member , will indefinite or .
Their lives here as in a was ; a new in to the other while go .
The book the mr Englund is a handicap of the books of history standard .
Is also a to the notion of that first war World only was the war of in the with Western .
&quot; the beauty and the pain of the battle &quot; at of way skilled to through of other of war : the Alps , the Balkans , the with Eastern , Mesopotamia , Africa the .
To the soldiers in this book them give above the ; one is the Christmas in Egypt under the ; the crack tse-tse are a problem .
This is a book , almost since the start .
The war the lives of these people as a natural disaster , a Hurricane Katrina that to .
When the ceasefire of it as in the distance , and you a woman that is in home with your children , you or ?
Of all forms who next ?
Almost nobody understand what that is happening , not even what has that fight this war .
&quot; we of facts &quot; , is the mr Englund , &quot; has with , , hopes , scares , ideas fixed , Corporation of the , dreams , and questioned &quot; .
&quot; the beauty and the pain of the battle &quot; still to individuals as Florence Farmborough , a juliet English in the army Russian , and Richard Stumpf , a young German of the fleet of high sea .
Their stories have successful in their greater part of transported , letters and another material already published before .
The explanations of their lives can be or , but are more pictures of life in the accumulation of small at , details stumbling , the mr Englund .
Many of these are about of and of bust with what that there .
About of have the history of a German says : &quot; Sucedáneos , all parties &quot; .
&quot; Sucedáneo of coffee , aluminium untrue , rubber of imitation , of role , of wood . &quot;
Continues about of the food in Germany .
Describes &quot; meat nation to from of rice and in blubber of Carlos ( and with a untrue fact of wood ) ; tobacco fact of roots and of dry potatoes ; shoes with of wood &quot; .
There , is , &quot; 837 substitutes of the meat in the production of , 511 substitutes the coffee registered &quot; .
Some stories are about the honour and the value .
A American recognised their own momentum towards the who and to about of the war : &quot; Sientes that , after of all , this is for what that men are some and not for who in with an and a bootleg , the newspaper of the later or a Impact , and removing that paints means civilisation and that not there a barbaric behind of that and . &quot;
In change a Bronze British account of that probably , and of that nobody or you .
&quot; a time that one the thinking of , to one you like think that could happens front the public &quot; , says .
In change , is be &quot; to a condemned being in secret &quot; .
Other comments are about of an old Europe builds , and about of new types of terror .
&quot; the conflict has become every time more in a economic competition &quot; , says the mr Englund , &quot; a war between factories &quot; .
Is the arrival of what that he is &quot; a new kind in the young century : the murderer in mass and convinced with of good textiles that executes their fighters while is at behind of a &quot; .
The people means of ways ; there therefore behaviour as .
The mr Englund about of the soldiers that us actively catch a disease of prostitutes as way of evade the service in the with .
&quot; the expression more redeeming of this can see the trade of relative , that soldiers buy and with this their with the hope of end in the hospital &quot; , says .
&quot; those that are truly desperate what on their eyes , what that to often place to a of life . &quot;
In this translation the Swedish nation serious Peter , the mr Englund but not , is perfectly to their task human .
In dozens of small scenes is the way in the war to &quot; up forces : nationalism extreme , social revolution , hatred religious &quot; .

The seconded of workers of support to the city the redundancies
The seconded that represents to hundreds of workers of support school that lost their jobs the last month planning exceeding to the city the Wednesday , say that redundancies were superfluous and discriminatory because to their impact on the schools that to poor students .
The demand is , possibly , the last weapon to available the seconded , the municipal district 37 , in their effort the redundancies .
Seiscientos was and two assistants of the school , the coordinators of parents and other employees that were between the worst paid of the city lost their work the 7 of October , in a movement that leaders trade have to as a policy their negative to allow , the last spring , the access part of the city to a Fund of assistance health to office of groups of work for close their gap budgetary .
The municipal authorities have denied categorically that prosecution .
In a hearing in the City the last month , the of education , Dennis M. Walcott , said that redundancies were a part the budget approved in June .
A Member the Council him that nothing in the budget that Member the personal of support of the school would dismissed .
Officials the municipal district 37 said that tabled the complaint writing , the department of education of that would scrutiny . Se will a conference of press the Wednesday for announced the presentation official of the demand , in the Court Supreme state in Manhattan .
The demand include the Sr. Walcott and the department of education of the city as accused , and account with eight workers dismissed as advice , all them women this or , the as that majority of the assistants that lost their jobs .
Elizabeth he , spokesman the legal department of the city , said that city not had seen the demand and what therefore not could to comments on their specific claims .
According a draft of the successful demand the chosen York Times , the seconded has focused in the number of redundancies in the schools of poor areas of the city for support a complaint treatment unfair , saying that poor schools lost more assistants , already that had been contrary of way of .
Se out that if well not there redundancies in Staten Island and a few redundancies in the schools in the Upper Crisis Side or TriBeCa , 17 assistants schoolchildren lost their jobs in the district 23 in Brownsville , Brooklyn , and 46 were dismissed in the districts 8 and 9 in the southern the Bronx .
Taking in account the loss of five of the eight assistants employees the school public 36 in Harlem , where the 68 cent of the students live in the poverty , the demand says , &quot; this is not an area of parents wealthiest that they custom funds for cover the deficit budgetary &quot; .
P.d. the budget the district 36 reduced in a 3.26 cent this year , and also lost money when the city changed the way in that estimated the additional funding for every abolition student poor in the schools .
The seconded also says that directors of schools imperative can have been unaware the language in a that forming the learn of the coordinators of parents .
The his the word &quot; surplus &quot; for under the action , to despite of that &quot; surplus &quot; describes with greater often the act of enterprises to a master of the of a school to an exchange of work , whose just are paid the office Central .
&quot; sixty and six coordinators of parents were dismissed &quot; , says the draft of the complaint , &quot; and not only in surplus &quot; .
Mission despite , the Congress prepared for to to an agreement on Libya
Seems that finally Republican and democrats in the Capitolio are prepared to only of agreement on something related with the embargo in Libya .
All what that needed was that which had success , that contractor dictator Muamar the Gaddafi outside apprehended and murdered and the participation of States United came to their end .
The Tuesday , the Committee of Affairs Foreign the Senate is to be a resolution , the President John Kerry ( democrat Massachusetts ) , with with the John McCain ( Arizona ) and Joseph I. Lieberman ( independent Connecticut ) , to the who their successful which and to the troops of EE.UU. their &quot; courage &quot; .
&quot; this resolution is for to the of Libya , the start to rebuild their country &quot; , said Kerry .
&quot; is a claim of support for their democratic aspirations . &quot;
The language can appear , but nothing on the debate on Libya has been easy to now .
This summer , the legislators of both parties between and with the home White on the wording of a series of resolutions for approve or reject the role of the military of EE.UU. in the mission of the NATO in Libya .
In June , Kerry and McCain tabled a resolution that forming the use limited of military forces of EE.UU. in Libya .
The project of law was in the House a broader for , and that never came to in the Senate .
But the same day in that project of law was rejected in the House , the House also rejected a measure that would the funds for the operations Americans in Libya .
For he the mission of EE.UU. in a kind of legislative purgatory - with the Congress what enough upsetting as for criticise the within part of Obama of the mission , but not so as for in reality the under their feet .
To continuation , the Congress was the events .
Trípoli fell in hands of the rebels who in August , and Gaddafi was murdered the 20 of October .
The mission of the NATO end officially the 31 of October .
Now the Senate could be completed for act .
The resolution the Committee of Affairs Foreign &quot; welcomes the people of Libya their courage and extraordinary resistance for Authorities to ourselves &quot; and &quot; commends to the men and women of the forces armed of States United and to their partners of the coalition that took in military operations for protect the people of Libya their extraordinary courage and professionalism &quot; .
The resolution also &quot; states the national interest of the States United in a successful and irreversible transition towards the democracy in Libya . &quot;
Going the new measure the completely support of the Commission of Affairs Foreign , or to the legislators as was the project of law of June ?
The last version was rejected the Senator Richard G. place ( Indiana ) , the main the Committee .
The spokesman of place said the Monday that not had seen still the version end the new project of law .
The another on the Capitolio , the House is to vote this week on an amendment Constitutional demanding a budget employee , a legislative priority for almost all the Republican and some democrats .
The measure , the Geldof Goodlatte ( prominent ) , will the first amendment Constitutional on the budget or any another issue that of fact a vote of whole the House in the House or the Senate in this Congress .
Other legislators not have had success to the time for to to their amendments to the House , but not lack of attempts .
The of Goodlatte is only a of the 68 constitutional amendments that have wonderful in this Congress , a wider range of subjects .
Some are - the same project of law proposes therefore in the House as in the Senate - and other with small shift between .
There what least 15 versions of the amendment the balance budgetary so only in the House , and another handful that &quot; be the expenditure Federal . &quot;
Some of these projects of law also are between , but are to their - on all Republican job that for their - the opportunity of of that them were the &quot; authors &quot; of this measure .
The law of control of budget , that was adopted in August , that therefore the House as the Senate voted an amendment the balance budgetary .
In March , 58 voted to favour of a resolution not binding that supports the idea of that amendment .
More beyond the budget , several Member want limit the number of that Member the Congress can to , while that representative José E. Serrano ( democrat new York ) , to validity the limit of two for the Presidents .
The representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr . ( democrat Illinois ) has proposed a series of amendments a right to an education of quality and attention health , between other subjects .
An amendment that prohibits the marriage homosexual is a proposal , so as a that prohibits the burning of flags .
Some legislators also want allow the seeking of the federal laws if are been two thirds of the States .
So enthusiasts that have been the Member to the time of propose amendments , not are strings to a pace more quickly that in previous years .
In the 111º Congress , the legislators proposed 77 amendments , and tabled 66 in the 110º .
The pace is unacceptable in compared with the of the of 1990 , when the Member were regularly more of 150 amendments every two years , according figures the library the Senate .
But not had a more success then of what that what have now .
The last amendment that added - the 27 - was resting in 1992 , but of fact was proposal the Congress in 1789 .

In the interview with Sawyer , Giffords , that ago two hours of been all the days , said that not reminds the day the shootout .
Their bearing said that was to Giffords a Article the newspaper on the murder the 12 of March when she what concealed for ask first time about of the six that had died in the incident .

&quot; very people died &quot; , you said Giffords to Sawyer .
&quot; hard , hard , hard . &quot;
His you said to Sawyer that in a time of the recovery of their wife , she said : &quot; I been . &quot;

&quot; so only Olivier been severe .
And you to out of this , and you to and you to again with more force that never . &quot;
The troops do feel more that respect
The event was a by of Wall the million of dollars for the home in new York .
Kid rock sung a on the powerlessness , the frustration and the loss .
In that time , several hundreds of soldiers , sailors , and of Marina Jaramillo in their jobs in about to he .
The of though it of ordinary and .
&quot; the men and women were who as heroes &quot; , said David Saltzman , who organised the revenues of funds of spring .
An military official of high they in the by , also known as the then President the state greater whole , the Mike Mullen , was the role of the troops of different way .
&quot; the were as a kind of child &quot; , wrote the official in an electronic email .
Am sure of that organizers they good intentions .
Se that they .
But not was respect , of truth . was .
The from at incompatibility the difficult relationship that has helplessness of the military and a public US to often , to sometimes , .
Se to the troops with praise their sacrifices .
But the has a price , say the Member the service .
The public every time more it as if you it those .
&quot; we not .ictims in no &quot; , said the general of Brigade are B. MacFarland , who the troops in Iraq and soon towards Afghanistan .
&quot; but seems that only way of that some demonstrate their support is put to us in the role of souls . &quot;
The issue is an issue very sensitive for the military leaders , that not want appear or in disagreement with the public the serve .
Also are account of that IRA to the troops that were in the last years of the war of Vietnam was a worst .
As result , the majority of the discussions on the have to out in silence and in private between the of war .
After of that their two children were of combat with the Infantería of Marina , the Colonel withdrawn Mark Cancian them warned of that people from of the military considered their service since two prospects .
Some them with a sense of fear because to that to the insurgents and they to places .
Other if would a &quot; contractor and turn below of the surface &quot; , said Cancian , that fought in Iraq and came to a work of high level the government in Washington .
For their for of employment , said , felt that some you had was if would capable of under the pressure of an assignment work of Washington immediately after of their this of combat .
&quot; when about of your service , to with to the from negative &quot; , reminded Cancian to their children .
From the military concern , in part , of the fighters US towards the wars .
The achievements in the field of battle are rarely time elected for the part of a country that has little with the military and is few direct profits of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan .
&quot; us , as nation , already we not .he military of ways that were the all common in the second war World &quot; , said the general Deputy withdrawn David Barno , who the troops of EE.UU. in Afghanistan .
In change , the praise of the political and the public concentrate in great measure in the depth the suffering of a Member the service .
The troops are recognised the number of that have , the number of friends that have lost or the reach of their injury .
The army a growing pressure for end with the violation
This week , a historic hearing decide if 28 women and men have a case against the army their conciliation passivity to the violation .
If not , hundreds of advice are organising for the next .
The Bronze of first Elizabeth Lyman had 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnancy the night in the she says that was raped an about .
Was October of 2008 , and respected of return to their Guardia in the basis airline Miramar , the North of St Garcia , after of the dinner with a friend when found with a colleague that was a package of 12 of beer .
He you asked if could joining to she in their room for take a World .
&quot; Sonó a signal of alarm &quot; , says Lyman .
Sin however , the of Texas he to a on their concern .
Thought , not , has 19 .
&quot; is of Texas &quot; , says .
&quot; May would heard to my prompts . &quot;
To the few minutes of into in the room of Lyman , the man you behind , towards from and , referendums .
This week , the 18 of November , Lyman and other 27 Member the personal military current and old expect a legal decision in a historic trial that will in Arlington , prominent , that decide if the demand that have against the of defence Robert garage and their predecessor , Donald Rumsfeld , fare to trial .
The demand referendums that garage and top Rumsfeld in the reduction of the violation widespread between the military , in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers .
A in February Susan Burke , a who of Washington , D.C. , the demand discussed at to 17 advice , but to 28 in the months following , 25 women and three men , all them claim that were or sexually their colleagues , and that army owned to the time of with , assertion , or offence justice appropriate after of the subjected .
Burke says that is to the flat greater the army , because the problem beginning with them .
&quot; the army is a structure of down towards from &quot; , says .
&quot; who are the people that are in conditions of eradicate the culture of the ? the high was . &quot;
Burke also says that since February , have since in contact with she close of 400 survivors more , many of the which could be part of future demands .
Their strategy : in place of consecutively to all the advice in this case , by all the eggs in a same basket , so say , is to it several cases , of be necessary , for keep the pressure .
The team of the defence for the department of defence , the tax Federal Voyager MacBride , has tabled a motion for underestimating the case .
The documents the Court , and Newsweek , detailed the strategy of -en defence essence , that military not can be current soldiers or old the injury subjected in the forces armed .
Por a ruling the Court Supreme of 1950 call the entailed Feres , the government Federal is not responsible the damage the personal in active service .
&quot; the damage are part the military service of the advice &quot; , say the documents .
The department of defence refused to to comments for this Article .
The things have changed since the years 50 .
While that to the women still them is officially ban serve in combat , this distinction is only roll : the wars modern rarely time have clear the lines the with .
Therefore in Iraq as in Afghanistan , the equipment of women Bronze are papers every time more important , especially for to to the local women in areas of war .
The result : between these two wars , 150 women Bronze have died and two thirds of them in situations of combat .
Is time of that army also , says Burke .
She is not single in their fight , and other three demands are in , also the their .
In the bioaccumulative of right of Yale , the clinic of legal services for Veteranos is about a case against the four main military academies supposed promote an environment .
other Por part , the organisation mind of profit Vietnam Veterans of America is his demand against the army that on in the verdicts of &quot; nuisance of the status &quot; allocated to the victims of violation with the end of them the high the service -un basin common , according the activists , as Anu Bhagwati of the network of action of women in service , a group of human rights .
Their group presented a demand in December against the administration of Veteranos , of practices discriminates in the way in that attacked the complaints of profits for the people that say have been sexually in the service .
Se have tabled nine projects of separate law in the Congress part of a of and representatives , for a series of votes .
In 2010 there 3.158 subjected sexual , according the office for the prevention of the sexual aggression and answer the department of defence .
Sin however , the subjected are a , and the own estimates the Pentagon , that figure in approximately the 13.5 cent of the 19000 incidents ladies that there that year .
The report , published in March , also distribution the we of prosecution : in 2010 , a 20 cent of the cases in the army was to trial - the half that in the system of justice civil .
The advice in the case of Burke , their attacks as only the first of a series of there .
In the case of Lyman , deplored the violation to the military police least of a time after of that .
That night , says , you asked that details of their violation 11 sometimes various to a of police , doctors , and staff .
She concluded to a of violation , and the blood of their -de a Court in their brazo- was Karl in their bed .
Six months after , in April of 2009 , Lyman relocation to a hearing to a judge , for the which you asked about of that would had sexual relations with their the day the attack .
Six people they as witnessing of status in name the alleged author , that was finally .
&quot; remember the day in that Surján the verdict &quot; , says Lyman .
&quot; thought that I was to go the work -me i shouting since the room . &quot;
&quot; I put in the unit of , and when I , remember that you I to my official of was , &quot; &quot; that not was their trial . that was my trial &quot; .
To Lyman you warrant visiting to a military , that finally you worker a nuisance of the status , what that was not for the service .
In January of 2010 was the service under terms menos-que-honorables , what that you from receive any benefit .
In as to if the case tabled Lyman and their colleagues of demand continues , is a possibility very Well , says John Turley , Professor of right in the bioaccumulative of right George Washington .
Sin however , out , &quot; in my opinion , should be able of to forward &quot; .
What that between them and a verdict is this entailed that has been since that published first time .
I been a critical permanent of the entailed Feres .
The army is decades behind because not has the same incentive and deterrent that with the responsibility .
And adds : &quot; the back are are in against of them ... but is important for them try . &quot;
These things only period when the good people is ready to fight .
If the hearing is not their way , Burke , who of the advice , will to the EU to their other hundreds of advice for future cases .
&quot; we to to fighting against the army in this issue to that reform would &quot; , says .
&quot; or to that we , what that happen first .
The walls have eyes : how the researchers you are at in Facebook
Before of become in the new face of the extreme right in Europe , therapy Behring Breivik was simply another kind that their points of view anti-inmigración in line .
The Monday , Breivik , who befriended have done a killing in Norway in July , that he 77 dead , Brigades to their first legal public hearing .
While Breivik can have action only , was far of be only in the : had last the greater part the time that preceded to their attack with to their computer , with some of the million of nationalists that support to the groups of right in social networks .
After of the tragedy of this summer , the researchers wanted know more about of these people .
But , how ?
Easy - only you that into in Facebook .
&quot; we account of that not was so difficult to to them &quot; , says Jamie Bartlett , author main of a report published recently on the populism European digital the centre of British studies let .
The of personal information of Facebook is so , says Bartlett , that researchers could simply use the tool of advertising for determine their characteristics with a precision scientific - the way that sellers have state being for years .
The team of Bartlett found a million of fan of the groups of right in whole Europe and then them announcements , but in place of to a new bandwidth or product of , the announcements to the users to complete a survey that he on their level education , attitudes towards the violence and the optimism on their own future .
The to to through of Facebook , Bartlett and their colleagues were able of to to more of 10.000 followers of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 European countries - all out of the office .
&quot; is a way completely new of to a research &quot; , says Bartlett .
Some of the results not are the all surprising : the supporters in line of the groups of right tend to be young , men and the immigration .
Sin however , in a kind of drawing , &quot; those that combined their in line with the outside of line are more reasonable , more democratic and least violent that those that are behind of the screen the computer &quot; .
The work of let is only an example of how Facebook is becoming in a new and important tool in hands of the scientists .
Centres of research , researchers doctors and political scientists are being the website for to all , since problems of health to social such trends as consent in the &quot; I like &quot; , messages in the walls and dialogues of state .
With more of 800 million of active users an average of three parts of content the day , the &quot; of data &quot; of Facebook is and a on of the research , pushing the number of academic jobs with the name the website in the title to almost a 800 % in the last five years .
For some researchers , the beauty of Facebook is that you allows to to the people to the not with a in the street .
&quot; before , when to people the national British party , was very difficult . &quot;
&quot; Tendrías that go to through the party , and them never you creation the access &quot; , says Bartlett .
&quot; Facebook would all that - you to them directly . &quot;
Other say that website could provide a way of identify and address the problems of salud-social .
A recent study done the Megan seaside , of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and their colleagues , found that students it that they of their of in Facebook they a risk significantly greater of have problems with the drink that students that refused in silence on the issue .
Seaside suggests that colleagues of the students , such as the dispatches , could control the website and intervene for help to a student that requires too dialogues of state with their binge .
&quot; not you try a problem if not what you &quot; , said Dimitri Christakis , the co-autor of seaside and director the centre of health , behaviour and development the child in the Institute of research child of Seattle , said the Washington ex .
&quot; we found a way of identify children in risk that of another way not would . &quot;
Facebook also is constantly &quot; &quot; to their own population for obtain data .
The team of data the website has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and the day of St on , the expectation of participation electoral to half the period legislative of 2010 , and a rate of Škottová national ( mainly being the information to the can access - defenders of the freedom digital ago a time that maintain that website should to to available of other their great amount of data for the research ) .
Sin however , the users of Facebook know that website them is looking , them whether or not - the power playing the Scrabble with a friend to thousands of kilometres of distance is allow that website your personal information .
But what is when the users of Facebook spend to be part of a survey that not even know ?
While that researchers have guidelines well defined on how up their data outside of line , in line is a free for all .
&quot; not i that many of the users have thought even in the fact of a scientists could be examining their profiles &quot; , says Voyager Selwyn , a Todd the laboratory of knowledge of London , on a study of 2006 that was to out with the public walls of Facebook of students .
&quot; in what that to them precise , was only between them and their friends . &quot;
Then is the question of the methodology .
Even outside of line , not there guarantee of an issue of research this being completely honest .
In Facebook , is impossible know that part of the information the profile of a user and of the messages the Wall are truth .
&quot; what that in Facebook and what that pensioner outside of Facebook are two things completely different &quot; , says Selwyn .
Is that , to despite of their years as scientists of the technology , Selwyn believes an and an are being the best tools of research that nobody can use .
&quot; not there substitute for into in the world real and about with the real people &quot; , says .
&quot; the social research is that is on what social - and a lot of what social still is outside of line . &quot;
&quot; cold and inhuman : therapy Behring Breivik ago their first emergence public in the Court
Therapy Behring Breivik , the man that be the which of the two attacks that killed to 77 people in Norway this summer , has to to same as a of the &quot; resistance &quot; for their first emergence public in the Court of Oslo .
&quot; am a military commander in the movement of resistance Norwegian and in the Gentlemen Templarios of Norway &quot; , said to a full room with 500 people .
&quot; I am the Court , already that received the mandate of the organisations that support the ideology the hatred and because supports the . &quot;
&quot; i the facts but not I adjourned guilty . &quot;
The judge Torkjel Nesheim was to Breivik for that , because &quot; not wanted to to Breivik the opportunity of use this hearing as a platform for that their points of view &quot; .
Por the same reason refused to allow to Breivik , that brought a speech writing with early , address to the family of their victims the end of the hearing .
Nesheim also warrant to the police keep to Breivik under custody for 12 weeks more , you banned the access to the media of communication for four weeks , and said that authorities should that have a narrower control on all the visits and the for eight weeks .
Around of 30 survivors and family of the victims speakers to the hearing .
Some as with the hope of look to Breivik to the eyes , other for confirm that is under key .
All speakers with the aim of move towards the conclusion .
&quot; thought that seemed cold and inhuman &quot; , said a of Utoya to the outlet Norway NRK .
&quot; was you , but for me was a step forward after of see and hear the suspect . &quot;
Clothing with a suit dark and I Blue , Breivik remained and professional to what long of the hearing and to the journalists and to the survivors to the eyes when been and went the building .
To despite of the strange notion of Breivik of be part of a movement of &quot; resistance &quot; greater , the judge that is not an mental ill , and said that not there evidence of that act with .
Is possible that to some them that attacks the 22 of unimaginable July be labour of a in place of a group of radical .
But that not automatically the pain and the confusion that whole a nation still feel .
&quot; I like that prompt a monster , but not what seems &quot; , said a family of a victim .

7 lessons of the interview delayed of Steve Jobs , show in a theatre this week
After the death of Steve Jobs , the 5 of October , there some that what with Henry Ford - the out of the technology as the great Inventor modern .
But what that fan of Apple could find more intend , in an interview to Jobs recently to the has as embargo of a series of special in the over markets this week , is how about this mind about of the processes trade and flows of work of the products .
Was doubt a leather , and , but also was a whoever and a of the of flow - a man that thought that many place &quot; a disease that is in think a great idea is the 90 cent the work ... &#91; but &#93; there a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product . &quot;
In 1995 , Geldof Cringely was developing the series of television the Triumph of the Nerds ( the of the ) on the personal computer , and did for more of a time with Jobs for a can and rarely conversation .
In that time had last barely 10 years since that Jobs had been forced to leave of Apple , and already working reality in their new company is NeXT , waiting the adoption popular of Internet .
While a small part of the interview of Cringely used in Nerds , said that original of the interview dissolved for their transport .
Was only after of the death of Jobs that found a full copy in VHS in the garage the director .
This material of archive , slightly , is the basis of Steve Jobs : the interview delayed , of 68 minutes , a to the Landmark this Wednesday and Thursday .
For someone known the interviews in depth , Jobs here seems surprisingly now to forward their infinite and strategies trade .
And very .
In four different points to what long of the interview , there large between the questions and the answers - of 10 to 15 seconds of , where Jobs is clearly their thoughts , for precision .
Also there at in the of Jobs its to the surface , where seems because to the questions of Cringely , to go more quickly towards the subjects or arguments of greater importance .
Filmado before of the was of Pixar , the or the , there something in the interview delayed , when Jobs what that is that other companies do well and , and offers their own vision the future of the is .
A thing is read assessments of the career of Jobs , but there something oil and in the Jobs that we here , the on of the greatness .
He has a vision of as can and must be the things .
Not an after of all with detail here , was and what was .
A quickly short of seven triumphs of the interview delayed :
On how to to a business :
&quot; to what long of the years in the business , I always he : &quot; &quot; Por what pensioner things ? &quot; and the answers that you are of way are : &quot; oh , that is only the way as ago &quot; .
Nobody know what ago what that ago , in the business nobody think in the things very deeply .
That is what that i .
Jobs has the detail their efforts for simplify the accounting of Apple .
Desconcertado the way in the costs - to often beginning with a &quot; standard cost &quot; that was to eye of good , and that then position with a &quot; one &quot; - developed a factory that could determine the costs trade the detail .
On the joke the Pope :
Jobs the &quot; box Blue &quot; that he same was with Steve Wozniak - a has that did to the people effectively the company telephone and to on to long free distance .
Se has writing this about the has , but the euphoria of Jobs here the under the box Blue as an act of is .
Describes how he and Wozniak the box by the use of a telephone public , doing a call , and then since a network of AT &amp; Ts to other , while a with the greater amount of possible satellites .
&quot; were the things around the world an average dozen of sometimes and to through the telephone public and readjust a minute more later the telephone public of the door of the on &quot; , says Jobs with a .
&quot; distinguished young and what that learn was that we build something us ourselves that could control thousands of million of dollars in infrastructure in all the world . &quot;
Us two , not knew a , but we build a small thing that could control a thing heralded - was a incredible lesson , and not i that never would been Apple she .
Jobs continues a joke that he and Wozniak almost record , the heavenly to through of the box Blue in half of the night and requesting about with the Pope , while was their better imitation of Henry Kissinger .
To measure that several Member of the hierarchy Catholic were in half of the night for about with the diplomatic US , the two in fair before of that Pope outside foul for go to answer the telephone .
On of the technology ( and the sale telephone with garage Hewlett ) :
To the age of 12 years , to the hunting of parts of spare for build a of often , at to garage Hewlett in the on telephone and you was a call .
Little after of their conversation telephone of 20 minutes , Jobs managed an employment of summer to time over in Hewlett-Packard .
&quot; that was a remarkable influence on me , was the only company that had seen to that age and formed my vision of what that was a company and what well that to their employees . &quot;
Jobs became after in one of the employees of HP that they the laboratories of research of the company in high Palo , where was &quot; the first computer of table never fact &quot; .
Was so large as a GDR , had a small screen of , and I of he .
Conseguiría a journey to HP as girl and lose the time with that machine and programmes for she .
On the innovation :
In several points of the interview , Jobs about about of new reinvent products on the .
Soon in their career , already that he to sell a handful of Rachinel basis , you asked a client if could they all the team .
Working with only 30 days of credit , had that physically the and the over of the equipment .
More later , while was in Apple , reminds the struggles to the Brigades in the development of a of computer :
&quot; I agreement of have dramatic arguments ... I that be five years &#91; for create a that 300 dollars &#93; , and I and I i outside and i a leather .
Nineties days after , had a that we build 15 dollars and that was completely reliable .
On the large companies losing force :
A before of that you of Apple , Jobs foresaw the way in that many leaders of the industry in their vision , and the control of their share of market .
&quot; realised that in IBM or Xerox , what that pensioner and best , and what ? &quot;
You has the monopoly of the share of market , what that company not has more success .
The departments of sales and marketing increase the success , what that are this class of people the end you the companies and the people peacekeepers of the products are the forum for the of decisions .
The out of the products that was to that position of monopoly fault of people that not have the notion of good bad products products - the knowledge the necessary profession .
That is what that happened in Xerox ...
Xerox could have of whole the industry is .
Could have been ten sometimes their size , could have been the Microsoft of the years 90 ...
Were the defeat of the victory .
On the innovation as artistic expression :
&quot; there a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product ... to measure that great idea , time and overall . &quot;
Se learns an about of the of the same .
There sacrifices that you that to - some things that not you to that do the glass the ago , the do , the factories the do .
You that keep 5000 things in your which - these concepts - all to the time ...
The end all reduces the will - forcing to try to what better a team of human has fact , and then try of adapted these things to the your with doing .
Artistic said that good artists copied , the large artists .
Never we had shame about of large steal ideas .
What that in part was large the Macintosh was that people that were working in he were musicians , , artists , , coexist , that wrong were the best scientists baggage the world .
If not outside the is , could be doing things in other camps .
Scalia and he with the rival of the law of assistance health while the Court on the case
The day that Court by met to door closed for at the question politically controversial of if the challenge to the law of assistance health the President Obama , two of their officers , Antonin Scalia and Clarence he , were in a dinner the signing of lawyers that case to the high Court .
The occasion was the last Thursday , when the nine judges met in a hearing preliminary for to which the petitions of review .
One of the cases in question was a demand a 26 States defiance the reform total of the assistance health adopted the Congress the last year , a law that has been an out of war for the activists Conservatives in all the country .
The officers admit to impossible the demand and , of fact , expected a historic plea of 5 hours and average for March , and the result probably still more the presidential career of 2012 , that will in plenary of in the time in that decision the Court man .
The lawyer that to the Court and that law must be will probably Paul Clement , who was as tax general of EE.UU. for the government of George W. Bush .
The signing of lawyers of Clement , Bancroft PLLC , was a of the almost two dozens of companies that to the annual dinner of the federal society , a group that has many years into to the defence of the legal principles Conservatives .
Other signing that dinner , Jones Day , represents to a of the associations trade that law , the national Federation of business independent .
Another was the heralded Pfizer Inc . , that has a huge financial interest in the result the dispute .
The dinner took in a hotel of Washington , hours after of the hearing preliminary the Court on the case .
Between the assistants was , between other , Hurricane McConnell , the more important in the Senate and a Maracaibo declared of the law of assistance health .
The invited special in the dinner ? Scalia and he .
Not is new nothing : the two judges have factual state to events of the federal society for years .
And is not something that between in conflict with the ethical rules .
Of fact , the judges are the code of for that applied the actions of the federal officers lower .
If not what they , could said that under the code Canon 4C , that says : &quot; a judge can attend to events for custom funds of organisations relating with the law and other , although the judge not can be a speaker , an invited of honour , or put in the programme of such event . &quot;
Sin however , the absolute of Scalia and he to two of the of lawyers in the case , so as to a company with a huge financial interest , was enough for to the activists of ethical in the government .
&quot; this impressive gap of the ethical and fighters towards the code is in against of the demands of several officers that by the Court the same rules that apply to all the federal judges &quot; , said Geldof Karadzic , the President of Common Cause ( common cause ) .
&quot; the judges were in a revenues of funds of by with lawyers that have outstanding cases to the Court . &quot;
Their emergence and assistance in the revenues of funds for this event undermines any demand of influences , and is unacceptable .
Scalia and he have shown little interest the criticisms that say that too easily the activity the Court with the agenda groups as the federal society .
And the wife of he , Ginni , is an excel encountered conservative .
other Por part , the Conservatives argue that is the Sakharov Kagan , the has a problem favours , not Scalia and he .
Kagan worked as general of the administration Obama when tabled the first legal challenges to the law in the Court of first ultimately .
Their critical have preferred for that Kagan renewing of see the case , saying that was too in defend the law as for now be neutral .
Kagan not has given no indication of that what will to to .

&quot; the quality of these customers in particular is very strong . &quot;
Many airlines of East an are property of their nations of oil .
Por what therefore , not only have the money for pay the planes , but an increase in the prices the fuel - what general harmful for the lines airlines , because is one of the over costs - is not so harmful , because the country is gaining money with the increase the price the oil .
That is important because have least back that other airlines of cancel or delay the orders of flight when the prices the fuel increase , said Dihora .

The asked of the Emiratos the leadership of boeing in the market of planes of wide and aid to keep to the attempt of their competitor Airbus SAS of invade their dominance with the air of passengers A350 .
The victory of boeing in the annual the air is four months after of that Airbus I that was to delay the debut the more large A350 , that competing directly with the 777-300ER .
Was the debut for add more momentum after of that customers an increase of the burden useful and the they .
The actions of boeing co a 1.5 % to 67.94 dollars .

Serious the Pentagon about of the possible cuts in defence
The Secretary of defence , a Panetta , the Congress the Monday , that cuts dispensers of budget that could undermining the national security and to a financial reaction in chain since the corridors the Pentagon , to the camps of battle of Afghanistan , to the chains of civilians .
The Pentagon already is the 450 billion million of dollars of tries to what long of the next the , but now afraid a additional reduction of 600 billion million or more in cuts that can be imminent if the Congress not manages to to an agreement on the expenditure .
&quot; the impact of these cuts would devastating for the department &quot; , said Panetta in a letter to the John McCain , Arizona , and Lindsey Graham , Carolina the southern .
Said that failure the Congress for to to an agreement on the budget and their result , the called &quot; hostages &quot; , Choice place to a 23 cent of global tries and a high to many new projects .
&quot; a cut so large , applied of this way , would that greater part of our projects sonars and of construction not they result - not can buy three parties of a ship or a building - and damage seriously other efforts of modernisation &quot; , wrote Panetta to the .
&quot; also we forced to to many of our officials civilians of way and , because to that reduction with so quickly , is almost sure that we that civilians with the end of to the aim . &quot;
&quot; these changes the faith with those that are our army and seriously the good available . &quot;
The cuts with the time to the troops of combat , said Panetta .
&quot; if well the funding for times of war in the accounts of operations of in overseas is not directly affected the hostages , the efforts of the war would affected adversely the serious be in the budgets of basis &quot; , warned Panetta .
&quot; the procurement of personal , what that would to delays in the contracts and the supervision the contract that supports the war . &quot;
&quot; the personal in , giving place to delays in the payments to the suppliers in time of war , and the legal support and political would interrupted . &quot;
The two had writing to Panetta ago 10 days , asking information on the possible impact of the cuts dispensers in the department of defence .
&quot; the result of a hostages in the department of defence would a quickly decline of the States United as main military power the world . &quot;
&quot; we strongly in against of this action &quot; , said the in a release whole the later the Monday when the letter of Panetta .
&quot; this is not a result with the can live , and certainly is not one that we Agenda to us ourselves . &quot;
&quot; the hostages is a threat for the interests of the national security of the States United , and not must allow that happen . &quot;
If the letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of the will the pressure for a compromise budgetary or scrupulously the on for the Pentagon of the cuts is see .
Panetta has been every time more very on the possible cuts , to despite of that came to a work in the top the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in the Congress and the home White and that to decisions difficult .
In a conference of press the last week , the Secretary of defence a picture sombre of what that could be front - an army with a , but not a pounds .
&quot; is a ship sailors . &quot;
&quot; is a Brigade . &quot;
&quot; is an arrived airline enough pilots firepower . &quot;
&quot; is a tiger of role , an army of , buildings and bombs enough soldiers prepared for to the mission &quot; , said Panetta in their words of opening in the Pentagon .
&quot; is a force that suffering the low moral , the preparation inadequate and is not capable of in the day with the potential adversaries . &quot;
&quot; in effect , attend to the aggression ... &quot;
In a to their letters to McCain and Graham , new Panetta details of how the tries &quot; beautiful important operational risks : too in the time of answer to the crisis , conflicts and disasters ; limited our capacity of be you and committed a in all the world ; and is a unacceptable risk in future operations of combat . &quot;
And Panetta said that some of the over projects of defence could with the , including those that already are and some only in the first stages of the planning .
This list includes the air of combat F35 ventures Strike Fighter , a new to , the of new generation , the new ship of combat shallow and the new an of combat in land that army and the Marina need keen , the .
Stop the development and the additional evidence the F35 could generate a 80 billion million of dollars in obscure to what long of 10 years , but their supporters say that is the next step vital for improve and with the potential threats of China and other rival .
As detect a lie
A IRIS to the headlines more recent we that virtuous serious and curse are the deception and the lie in the life daily .
The presidential candidate Herman Cain is occupied accusations of sexual harassment with several women ; every part accused of lie to the other .
The administrators of the University state of Pennsylvania have been accused of supposed conceal reports that were a you of football withdrawn was sexually to children .
The last week , the President French , Claus Sarkozy , was &quot; &quot; with a open microphone saying the President of EE.UU. , Barack Obama , that first Minister Israeli Benjamin Netanyahu is a do .
Lie has destroyed to and countries .
The new York and in Internet , Anthony Weiner , was the ourselves with their quickly the test .
The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of breaches in the funding of the campaign relating with the of a relationship .
And , of new , nobody that what never the circus up the President garage Clinton the lie for their second mandate about of their relationship sexual with Mónica Lewinsky .
Are very the myths on the traps in the examinations of the school and the University .
Se have given cases in the teachers have given the answers of the examinations to the students with the end of be better seen in their assessments of performance .
Mentores that should be what contrary are sending the message of that lie and is are tonnage .
How deception we ?
In a day who , the studies show that you can lie in any place of 10 to 200 sometimes .
That sure , many of these lies are lies .
Another study was that issue three sometimes in the first 10 minutes of .
Detect lies , or &quot; the which of lies &quot; , is a as essential that we acquire all , reasons therefore personal as professionals .
Far of be a at of table similar to , example , Charada , where the aim is : &quot; you have &quot; , the detection the deception is a serious knowledge based in data scientists and for the last six decades in universities that held projects of research in depth , especially in and .
One of the results of the research is that old about of the lie have been .
The who to the eyes .
Not always , , or .
Not can conclude not that are difficult of detect or unmasked .
A of lies trained can to to the truth to about of the structure of the statement , the training of questions and the times .
I several years the scientists on the deception in the spectre and always shining body the knowledge , and was clear that detection the deception is a technical modern that is easy of learn and aid to friend our complex world - especially if their responsibilities professionals include the procurement , interviews , or the management of negotiations .
The good have the as of read well to the others , precise feel to will , their own emotion and of way how the were the others .
We the research that more that , that men say more &quot; lies win towards ourselves &quot; , while that women say more lies &quot; win towards the others &quot; -- normally for protect the feelings of someone -- that people married least responding to their partners that people that not are married ( but the lies that usually say tend to be &quot; enormous &quot; ) .
Also we that if you is Medina as the others least guilty the .
How know if someone is ?
First , rescindable the for her the taxed .
This is &quot; create a line of basis &quot; .
Aid to provide points of reference for measure after the changes .
Rescindable the position the taxed , and feature blues .
Is better that will if someone normally with the ordinary all the time for not to accusations upon when you see the feet in half of the meeting .
To continuation , groups of behaviour dull , and not .
Unpleasant to these groups of behaviour as signals of alarm , not as test of deception .
The people that con can freeze the part higher the body the try of remember their history , can emphasized their feet towards the door , towards an exit , change their position of way significantly or a &quot; &quot; -- that haven of and change of position a time that all the questions difficult have over .
To often the do see that interview has over only for to that .
Also happening attention the vocabulary the taxed .
Ayr Peterson the to the Fund and the last time while tenders that their wife murdered was , a for of she to level national .
The people that con also can use a language : &quot; not had sexual relations with that woman ... the Lewinsky &quot; or repeat a question difficult accomplished .
The indicators more common are .
Someone can use a lot of &quot; language been &quot; when says to a question difficult : &quot; good ... to say truth ... to what that I ... to my understand . &quot;
This ago that answer be a in place of a fact and is to often a signal of vigilant .
Not there no formula for detect lies , but develop skills for be the deception is possible .
These skills will the for of who for avoid be the artists of the mischief in their lives professionals and personal .

In first place , i that all we lucky of be still with life and , in second , all we into the others .
All we friends very those and , thank to that , also have open music that you are freedom to every one of shares .
We we the to the other with the music of every one and not could be better .
The relationship of you with the word reputation not has been simple ; however , thank to their success , have been to what that want .
How are a balance ?
To as we gone growing , has been more easy find a balance .
We ensure of that not be too of this because is easy we in that at of the large and of the people that him your music .
While one democrat that people is there the music , that you democrat that she respect the music and what that brought , be famous and be a rock , something that to none of us really you interested .
How reminds their another project Mother Love Bone ?
I that very good songs and the principle was something under .
Were a bandwidth almost three years and never tracing a to that after of that Andy ( Symeou Woods ) .
There many because therefore and what more important is that still we very friends of Bruce ( Fairweather ) and Greg ( Gilmore ) , that they in the bandwidth with us and when hear a song or see a photograph think in the incredible person that Andy was and how I was cry , always was a pleasure go to work , , about of music and and a more .
Was a be human surprising and what .
The national bandwidth the Robertas will the committed of open the shows in at rich .
Is true that you know their work , in special Eddie Vedder , and that for the opening ?
Sí , the production we sent with several proposals and that was the bandwidth that more we pleased , so that we Finns of see what that Robertas can offer in live and duty be very Have .
Por what always period the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter in live ?
That is a question for Ed ( Eddie Vedder ) , so that not know .
He the singing and i that what ago with what first that you happen .
As , what are their influences ?
many Are .
Within of the first that I occur are Geezer Butler , John Entwistle , C. J. Ramone , John Doe , Paul McCartney , Chuck Dukowski ...
many Are that could about whole the later on the I crazy .
How has achieved Pearl Jam keep relevant the to despite of not be already a fashionable ?
I that all us always we a little of the word .
When think in she , I reminds the gangs that given before , as Mudhoney , Soundgarden , Nirvana and all the arose the same time , and , if there Summer now , i that is marvellous something because is music that is the it listen and gangs as Mudhoney are doing now better music that never .
The principle , their music had a content more dark and now has again more positive .
To what must this change ?
Is interesting because i that there a couple of songs in the new Georgian that such unimaginable time more , but also there songs , as the End or Just Breathe that as as songs very shameful although can sound a little positive .
With both , when Ed I the , when the i and are songs deeply shameful .
I that when and there some in your life and lose to a family or a friend , these things start to movement your art and your music and these two songs , doubt , represent that for me .
Also , i that can be a person happy and still so power to music that be whites .

The invaders had of 11 of the 13 strip the building , in Balmes , 51
The 12 was the at of yesterday offer resistance
All seems indicate that living the neighbours the 51 of the street of Balmes has come to their end .
Twelve people abandoned the at of yesterday volunteer the within illegally , and where that , legal order and need of an intervention police .
When end the operation , changed the of the door for avoid that repeat the situation .
&quot; to from of now will a control of access &quot; , said the administrator .
The , that had plagued 11 of the 13 strip the building -el rest are habitados- , were whole the plant we and part of the water , also of paint the walls and to waste of all kind , on all of excess excess .
The three first strip were the stage of the testing , that to two days and to the .
The on the building there a , Balmes 51 , that also has seen printed .
Their role , Maria Pantinat he to Europe reporter that since that building was occupied the business has down a 80 % .
The role of the as that invaders of the you the competition unfair , already that to three EUR , while in the 10 .
Also , the role the local of leisure had had that to to complaints noise , while , according pointed , the bother not the their the customers of the , but the inhabitants of the home and , on all , the assistants to the testing that there , that had increased their often and modern in the last weeks , according the neighbours of the area .
The responsible of the he that bother were so large that even came to an agreement with the you the and ago nine months that &quot; you &quot; the for .
The in urban also this for the last weeks had received more complaints of neighbours the situation .
The President the municipal group the PP in the City , Alberto of Villegas , had Karadzic the last week &quot; of way immediate the for end with the problems of them and that is to the neighbours , so as the exacerbate of the area &quot; .
The leader popular he that before the summer only had a floor the building occupied , but to what long of the last months the had gone their in all the plants the building and in almost all the strip , and that in one even have been seas .
In this sense added that , &quot; is necessary end with the impunity and be consist against the has led in the &quot; .
Also yesterday , the Mossos a building in Nou Barris .

Park or mountain ?
The architects line in the opportunity of the call more beyond of controversial on refunded
The municipal on the 16 doors the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
Amediados of the 80 , in plenary of of the already ICANN city of Barcelona ( CMB ) , this administration a of promotion of Collserola .
The mountain as the great park of the Barcelona city .
Is more , of a compared , in figures , with the Central Park .
With the death of the CMB , in 1987 , the park the to , in the imaginary of many , as the limit higher of Barcelona , being the capital of the few that not in the which norte-sur but down ( mountain ) -abajo ( sea ) .
The rating of Collserola as natural park sports in this idea .
The reference already not was Central Park but Yellowstone , with the in the role the Yogi .
In these was to that , in September , the City a states 16 notice for other many doors of access to Collserola .
A door planned to the idea of park , doubt .
Or that or someone to to doors the field .
The question its single : Collserola , park or mountain ?
The , therefore their it merely as what that is of reflection on the city is the issue of conversation between all the architects .
Is almost already an issue recurrent the to hand when two Member of this former hidden of elected recognise in a lift .
And this fact ordinary , exactly , to a of the few between what that opinion three architects , and teachers it , that have tabled .
Is Roldán , Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona : the is right .
For Roldán , after addressed the with shallow &quot; ago necessary &quot; discuss on &quot; the with of mountain &quot; , whole time that speech of Ildefons Cerdà , the of the peaches Greens , not has taken to out .
&quot; is from of the basis of that park more marine of Barcelona is the .
Between other things their great .
Collserola is more complex &quot; , ruling the architect for who the title of &quot; doors of Collserola &quot; within a &quot; trap &quot; : not there that think in them &quot; as the to a park , but the of an areas where there that act &quot; .
Mòdol , as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the world , described the proposal of &quot; challenge intellectual &quot; with &quot; some dangers &quot; .
Dangers derivatives of what &quot; uncertain that is today day project the space public &quot; after the experience in the 80 and that had in the area the Fòrum &quot; their enemy the &quot; .
The first fear is the own of a borders on where can build .
&quot; limit something is them already the next step &quot; , is say , their .
&quot; there that think in new instruments , of planning , because the current &#91; in reference the plan general Metropolitano ( PGM ) &#93; can to ordinary to disasters &quot; .
More to the question , Mòdol view that , , the it of Collserola &quot; can should as a park , the of Barcelona , not &quot; , a question merely .
Mòdol reminds that already there a work fact the Patronat of Collserola that &quot; not must we in together it &quot; , although thanks the opportunity that City offers to their of intervene in this project &quot; since the first time &quot; .
And still more , understand that of the mountain with the city is the convince that allows to the architects into in the debate , but &quot; doubt &quot; on if is this technical profile the must lead the equipment ( &quot; all a likewise &quot; , as ) that have had that create : &quot; the architects should be only a tool &quot; .
Bayona nothing that answer to the question that title to this one is complex , because in the foundation the lack a vision global of Collserola : &quot; Se have Swiss 16 notice direct -dice- in the sense montaña-mar , but not there a reading , that see and understands the area in their whole &quot; .
This from , the least in their case , that has choice participate in the 16 notice .
Of another way , a project for a of the doors can in programme and definition with the architect of the door of the on .
In their opinion , the City should ensure that Strip immediately higher to the round of Dalt should at , in whole their spread , an area of an anymore transition between the city and what green .

The Secretary Dionisio publishing Jácome details the accident air where lost the life the Secretary of Gobernación , which Blake , and seven people more
The Secretaría of communications and transport ( SCT ) informed that results onto on the accident where lost the life the Secretary of Gobernación , which Blake Mora , and seven people more , show that grant of way direct on the ground in full integrity structural , that pilot could try a landing implications .
For a conference of press , Dionisio publishing Jácome , Secretary of communications and transport , mentioned that before of controllers the pilot discovered that conditions of climate were the right for Class .
&quot; the elements that seem indicate that unit had several contacts with the ground , the had contact with trees to 25 metres where the unit lost the &quot; .
Also informed that unit was sewn for 19 people , what that had with the necessary for carry the personal .
Also , said that in the research made in the area the impact not the emergence of parts in the ground .
&quot; in a for our that not there parts or components of the in another place , the impact presented of structural way .
&quot; the design the grant was for 19 passengers , had with suitable for to the passengers .
The ground is an outstanding of seven degrees to the 30 degrees of gradient .
Por the time , the Secretary was that is a priority have with the results before possible ; however , the research can last several months , even could achieve a year .
Por their part , Gilberto Valverde Albert , general director of airports and services diagnoses , was that time the impact , the grant the state greater presidential in at of cruise and that happened in a ground ascending .
&quot; this information strengthens the of an normal operation of cruise the time the impact &quot; , expressed .
In the conference of press , the photo of the SCT , publishing Jácome , six element relevant in the research :
Flight about :
With to the aeronautics the flight was under the rules of flight about , this means that must have visibility for the flight and the ground .
likely Conditions :
The in the AICM conditions right the sleep , with is the towards the area bordering between the DF and the state of Mexico were collected of to low all .
Routes :
Is likely that conditions of the has an area of will raising and greater visibility towards the valley of Cuernavaca .
Location the impact .
The of impact and the last registration of the radar line , probably before the impact not there loss of control not at in the very of flight .
Dispersión of remains of the in an area reduced :
The available information to the time it mean that impact happened in a very straight and of on .
The of of remains of the it mean that grant in the ground in conditions of structural integrity .
Not has been obvious of ceasefire or explosion :
In the website the are are in the remains of the of some kind of explosion or ceasefire .
The last results of the research show that could have had multiple contacts with the ground .
For the jobs of field have found parts of the to a raising of 9 billion 200 feet on the level a sea , the ground is an outstanding that is since the seven degrees to 30 degrees of gradient .
The photographs show the sequence in the expected to what long of said way .

After of the for cleared in an area more wider that website , around the accident , not have found parts pieces of the , what that strengthens the presumption of that impact presented in conditions of structural integrity .
Mss is Protocol for finding gene of obesity
At the social sure a research for be the gene of the obesity in children and young ; is supported in specialists the IPN
The Institute Mexican the social sure ( IMSS ) announced that at a research for be the gene of the obesity in children and young , of Protocol genetic &apos; of the obesity of the childhood and the adolescence &apos; , that will have with with the obesity .
In a release , the head of the unit of research medical in Bioquímica the hospital of Especialidades the centre doctor national century century , is cross Valverde , he that taken a team of doctors , nurses , and workers social .
Said team is supported specialists and a of the Institute national of health public ( INSP ) and the centre of research and of studies advanced ( Cinvestav ) the Institute Politécnico national ( IPN ) .
In the research attend to participate to the population be or not , come to the units sporting participants the IMSS in the valley of Mexico , where have to out the evidence to the age , all the I to from of the 8 : 00 hours .
Skills that Protocol started in the unit integrating Cuauhtémoc ( state of Mexico Poniente ) and that since the 8 of October , the activity has to out in the unit integrating Nezahualcóyolt ( state of Mexico East ) .
A time that ! the aim of together to 500 or 600 age , the study Unions in the unit integrating independence ( southern the district Federal ) and finally in the unit integrating Morelos ( the North the district Federal ) .
He that purpose of this research is know the components and the importance of the genetic with regard the development of the obesity and identify in children and young Mexican factors of risk for prevent the emergence of chronic diseases .
The we this 14 of November the day World of the disease , that aim is together to three billion children and young between six and 14 years of age , with the consent and supervision of their parents , for the implementation of specific on food .
Also them on the physical activity and background of diseases , with the purpose of avoid factors of risk that as disease or inadequacy .
Detalló that I them applies to all the participants measurements ( weight , stature , circumference of ) , the of pressure gauges , determination of the levels of , , and insulin and genetic ( search identify genes that to the obesity child ) .
Cross Valverde pointed that research attack to the concern of the professionals of the health the alarming increase of weight in the age .
&apos; the surveys of health of 1999 and 2006 signal that in so only six years there an increase , in the case of the children , of 77 cent in obesity , and of the girls of 47 cent ; in terms of obesity also observed a dramatic rise &apos; , skills the specialist the IMSS .
Pressed that justification for the for of the in that population the country from of other their genetic history .
Informed that in average , the Mexican has 65 cent of inheritance Indian American , 30 European cent and five cent Africa and this condition is in the genes that take to disease and too of weight .
He that of general way , the genetic of the obesity translates in the inability of baby the too of energy that ( lowcalorie ) and that transported in way of blubber .
The scientists he that direct benefit for the participants is the assessment contained of the children , what that allows detect if have some degree of obesity or obesity .
Even , said , the presence of of colour ( ) in bottleneck and , that show the likelihood of that and to .

Bury of the UNAM bumpy
Raphael Herrera , scientists of the bioaccumulative of chemistry of the UNAM , develops which with for produce a with better every , regardless of the environmental conditions and of temperature
If the signals that are the like demands , not would necessary close of 200 billion bumpy every season of dry in the area city the valley of Mexico , warned Raphael Herrera Nájera , scientists of the bioaccumulative of chemistry ( FQ ) of the UNAM , who was that if the process of construction and peacekeeping of an is the appropriate , the bumpy could radioactivity in amount or , even , be completely .
In their conference an technological opinion of the bumpy , in the framework the international year of the chemistry , it was to know that laboratory to their office develops which with for produce a with characteristics like to the bury , but with a greater resistance mechanics , therefore to high as to in temperatures .
Herrera Nájera that kind of which could used in places where the climate is extremely a , as some cities the North the country , for improve their every and , what therefore , the training of bumpy .
He that bury , the part more disproportionately the oil , is a whole of of , a of high weight , on , and other of under weight , on , that EMIs you are the their characteristic behaviour .
The behaviour the bury is in that to high temperatures , close of the 180 degrees , means as a tanks , to 120 degrees degree their is very high and to 50 degrees degree is a state almost hardest , while that to temperatures very in , the bury again , added .
What previous means that in the streets the resistance the bury is not uniform , but that is constitutes for the day of agreement with the environmental conditions and of temperature , warned the specialist in engineering chemistry .
The scientists of the FQ observed that streets of the city of Mexico in their majority are covered flexible , the which consists of six collected of materials , of the which the last three the bury .
Between the collected more is the , small stones in bury and then .
Every a of the is the , pointed , is with bury .
The vehicles and efforts , this allows that forces are very well in the .
If like of bury amended still better , opinion the draughtsman chemical .
On the , , put a last layer call of , the which is nation of a material of stone fine , is say , a bit that also in bury .
As is of the layer that is to be in contact with the of the vehicles , must have more force mechanics that and provide in the way .
The be the part the is to receive and salvage the efforts , the of required , also , have the thick appropriate and must they the material the is nation .
The climate , especially the content and the shift of temperature , also are a factor very important to be , in special the water , said , because affects significantly the every of the .
When the ground , the water you in the internal of the and is difficult that it , this level a of all the collected the and , what therefore , the training of bumpy .
In the process of training of a , said , the first in is the film of and only after affects the , but the damage not happens , but that is a process that should to the first signals with suitable programmes of peacekeeping .
The also Member the national system of researchers he that burden is another important factor in the training of bumpy and , the thick of every a of the collected the must go always in relationship with the burden and ensure that ! , for avoid that train bumpy responding .
Raphael Herrera warned that still there a that with and work on the bury , example , that in other countries already are even in the market and it the bumpy with easily and need of high use temperatures .

Currently shall &quot; crime and punishment &quot; , is a book of literature universal that all we read ; and today in day am I the book of Irene Nemirovski , a Russian , a book that is &quot; the of the blood &quot; &quot; .
An answer that little pleased first the term &quot; &quot; and second not explain of particular way of what way every one of the books that have there .
But the by the ceremony Melina manifested your relaxed and happy with the result &quot; the universe is is what that has that to .
And for whole the people , favour read a , &quot; the &quot; is a great book &quot;
Between the been says that to valley the .
A journalist that be the Corporation , the and the mrs that was all the hypothetical awarding ( challenge of Oster , vote the public the better suit notions , and as mother ) , &quot; that adherents the of the other has , to the as and that not in the stage &quot; .
And that in their first presentation in suit of one in the Hilton and their two in the evening of .
Although in both safe , that you missing the force and the impetus that representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic Valley .
Lent Osorio , journalist the programme &quot; as in home &quot; , the channel RCN opinion that fact of that Melina outside abroad who &quot; apparent that mrs that more awarding earns for the is not as as &quot; .
Also , valley was to what last very with the press , and there .
Other is that valley not in to the jury on their interest towards the social work , that is in last , the essence the national of beauty .
Por something , two days before of the election the international jury Lucy Doughty manifested that them a woman with the social needs of their .

The of Borg Hernán Orozco recognised that Melina not had the better body , that had best , &quot; but their problem of in the , that truth for my not was very , you bowed points in the last day &quot; .
Between therefore the journalist guido Hoyos , of the magazine Cromos as that mistake of the were the speeches that .

Por this Prize , that first time over the national of the beauty , after the belonging in suit of one about a that perform , therefore said that was the Raymundo you to Melina for not should the will of the crown .
Reality or not , what true is that Melina since today starts a year of , not as sovereign , but as who , position that you offered the possibility of represent to Colombia in one of the international designation the own a national .
Sin however , she will to the history as a of the to despite of their step Cartagena , you was the crown .
So was the work the lighthouse the of Alfonso Cano
A of Cali happened to the history as the man that death of &quot; Alfonso Cano &quot; .
The work of these officials is key .
The last 4 of November a CTI of Cali happened to the history as the man that identity the maximum head of the Farc : &quot; Alfonso Cano &quot; , to through the of their fingerprinting digital .
Of the seven that in the CTI , that week you the Question of &quot; availability &quot; to Eliazar González , a man of port Tejada that has 21 years working in the area of research legal .
The to their career , González worked in municipalities the from , where many sometimes had that more of five days in the jungle for to the website in the were the bodies that be be at .
In the 2000 found to the capital the valley and , then of to the courses appropriate , in , that is the study of the fur of , is say , of the of the hands and of the feet .
The week the operational against Alfonso Cano to Eliazar you warned that on minimum clothes for three days .
large Something you than .
The Friday in the night went for the Cauca in a grant since Palmira .
Was that should identify two bodies and that one of them was the man that respected to the more former the world , what that you ’ that on the card of Guillermo a Sáenz ( their real name ) .
Sin however , when came with the team of research the website in the was the not what Interinstitutional their physical aspect , therefore was very different the had seen in the media of communication .
Was , clothing as a All of the area , glasses and a more slip .
But the fingerprinting not .
Linked of a , ink , an and a , Eliazar the from fingerprints the with the of the card .
Their eye not you : was &quot; Alfonso Cano &quot; .
That same night , the man of port Tejada was the responsibility of the Minister of defence , Juan emperor Pinzón , that was the maximum head of the Farc .
In for of the left
For a of the Sijín of Cali the recognition that was the President Juan Manuel holy to Eliazar González , in the wheel of press the operational against &quot; Cano &quot; , is very significant .
Very people not known our work .
The is a science accurate , for of mistake , that can to to be key in the resolution of crimes .
From of the identification of bodies , the support research crimes as and murder and Chicago the identity of the people .
When aliens , many criminals have wishful or not have papers .
Us them we the impression and the look in the basis of data .
The scientists counted that , in a case of , you validity a part of wall of a home , therefore in that place the do had supported their hand for from a strong full box of and money .
&quot; the walls are difficult because not are land for from an impression , but in that case we obtain the left of whole the hand and identify the criminal , that had participated in different &quot; , reminded .
The fingerprinting also can seeking or reaffirm suspected in cases of murder .
Ago little found to a man died , with bottles of to their around .
Por a of the research a family could be suspect the crime and , indeed , a left in the bottleneck .
Although this not does that has been the murderer , what in the scene the crime .
A CTI he that in the items &quot; the fingerprinting with chemical or physical &quot; .
When officer , used an or cut for .
Then of the from are settlement to the Asif , that is the basis of data , or to the Registraduría .
&quot; the problem is that still there many xenophobic Columbians &quot; , pressed the expert the CTI .
Aclaró that not all is as shows in the programme of television CSI .
So as not all what that which is gold , not all what that it again left .
Sin however , if can be , if for the dynamic .

&quot; our idea is that , if the Court we not .llows again to in the place , we to on in some another place and the legal battle again to Zuccotti , so as to through of around and peaceful demonstrations &quot; , said one of the for the movement &quot; taken Wall the &quot; , Mark Bray .
Bray that answer of the &quot; &quot; the of their camp dictated personally the Mayor of new York , Michael Bloomberg , came to the courts , where the Lucy Billings issued an order that evacuation the place and did to the demonstrators to in .

The organisation will that are several hundreds of people the had installed in that point , where already has a delegation of religious leaders in shows of support to the those the movement and that has Treaty of with the police .
Between therefore , the place Zuccotti -que is a of property privada- still closed to the expected of the since of a legal view measures for this same Tuesday in the must analyse the legality of the evacuation of this brave .
Some of the demonstrators Workers to there and to these hours millions of that legal order and even the to the players that place , what that resulted &quot; some small clashes &quot; , pressed Bray , who deplored that some official by to the demonstrators .

Since the last month of March the macroeconomic economy was paralysed , still the devastating earthquake that inhumanity in a crisis nuclear , the worst disaster that country since the II war World .
The first estimates the government of Tokio the losses materials in 300.000 million of dollars , a coup that , despite the difficult context World , seems have .
After of three quarters of , the fact the internal product gross between July and September was for to indeed , definitely : the GDP a 1.5 % in compared with the previous quarter and a 6 % in rate .

Sin however , the real of the macroeconomic economy not on exclusively in the momentum he that attend to take the crisis for strengthen - or rebuild - the infrastructure , of the shortcomings for grow since zero .
Japan has foul , on all , thank to the development the consumption helping , that in the today represents the 60 % the GDP .
This one 1 % , the increase the expenditure in vehicles , travel and activities of leisure .
The stigma the
Tokio has the internal market , when the - the currency - has become in one of the &quot; values refuge &quot; the investors that withdrawing of the crisis of debt in the area euro and the shady forecasts of EE.UU. , a privileged that is as a in the accounts of the companies .

The badge proposes choose the President European suffrage universal
The first day the Congress of the Union Cristiano-demócrata ( badge ) , the Monday 14 of November , in Leipzig , has Objective large difficulties for withdraw withdraw , Chancellor and President the party cristiano-demócrata .
At not had including in the order the day the future of Europe , but the issue imposed in autumn , in particular for satisfy to the fighters that they that policy the government is currently too little strict with the Greeks and could become in a future with the Italian .
The motion on the Presidency of the Commission European , proposal the direction , adopted virtually unanimity .
Of the 1.001 delegates , so only registered nine votes in against and ten .
The of several minutes that , with their speeches , withdraw withdraw and , after several hours , Wolfgang Schäuble , the Minister of finance , any doubt possible .
The idea key of the Chancellor , and of the motion , short in a motto : the answer to the crisis &quot; is not least Europe , but more Europe &quot; .
Not only because Europe is the peace , but also because &quot; nine million of jobs on directly the euro &quot; .
For the Chancellor , &quot; has come the time of open way in Europe &quot; .
This could motivational in amendments the Treaty of Lisbon for allow strengthen the control of the Union European on the budgetary policies of the countries of the area the euro , although also could in the election the President of the Commission European suffrage universal for &quot; should a face to Europe &quot; .
In all case , that is a of the proposals of the motion adopted the Congress , clearly idea of Wolfgang Schäuble .
Sin doubt , is little likely that bringing are quickly to an agreement on this radical change : great Britain shows hostile to he and the leaders of the badge seem know that Nicolas Sarkozy also .
But the court is on the ground .
Por another on , the delegates have rejected a majority won the proposal of the weight of every country of the directive the Bank Central European in role the weight of every economy , what which obviously the weight of Germany .
Ansiosa the encouraged in the internal of their party , the Chancellor has increased the no to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl . but is not that has tried who to their Congress to at of the &quot; small &quot; European countries or of the countries in difficulties prepared to criticise to the byword Germany .
Although the motion on Europe he a paragraph to the importance of &quot; the Friendship franco-alemana &quot; , withdraw withdraw not has to France .
Unless of last .
Still that , ago two centuries , in a bloody battle in Leipzig .
Of fact , was a of the more humiliating for the army of Rostopchine .
The impact the fraud in the in disease
After the benefits , the UMP and the government a for against the in disease .
Nicolas Sarkozy will the Tuesday 15 of November in Bordeaux for visiting a responsible box of the benefits family and use a speech on the issue , already recurrent since 2007 , of the fight against the social fraud and the .
Also , for her such for , that part of the will of save of way thorough , but still so reminds to a which of the presidential campaign of right , the majority to firstly in the in disease .
In first place , for apply cuts budgetary : the government for impose to the workers the private sector a fourth day of we before of power catch the low .
In final , unless that there a Convention of specific company , a worker that ill lose four days of wage , is say , a minimum the 15 % of their income month .
Se is of a measure that could on a wave of IRA , but that would save 280 million of EUR , according them Echos .
Also , would accompanied of other measure with a reach more symbolic : impose to the officials a day of we remains in case of low labour ( to the time , not have we , with to the three days that apply in the private sector ) .
While these issues , the majority again to to on the table also the issue the fraud , this time looking towards the abuses of the in labour .
&quot; will to significantly the controls and , also , if which to someone planned a fraud , must the &quot; , warned Xavier Bertrand about in the RTL the Sunday 13 of November .
The as that in the other cases , the effects the announcement seem slightly for the reality the fraud in on of in labour .
Of fact , since 2002 for a monitoring constant of this question and have it various offensive policies that , normally , have given emerged .
The French not more that in the rest of Europe .
Handed with attention , in first place , the national figures .
According the Institute French of the social security ( CNAM ) , in 2006 more of 237 million of EUR in particular in labour .
According the Institute French of research and documents in economy of the health , the benefits the in , in 2008 , the 5 % the expenditure health , to 11.300 million of EUR .
Of this sum , the 46 % is to the in leave and accidents labour , while that 54 % is related with the in disease , figure that out to 6.200 million of EUR .
Por therefore , the 2.5 % the expenditure in health .
In 2010 , the French have an average of 14.5 days of low labour , with to 17.8 in 2009 , according a study the group soul Consulting .
An average that , doubt , behind government : other survey , published in 2007 the Syrian of professional management Monster.com , that 75 % of the 40.000 French workers rushing that not had not a only day of low disease .
Another study , in this case of the Assurance , that in 2010 the 37 % of the in disease had a than to 8 days , the 22 % of between 8 and 14 days , the 15 % of between 15 days and a month , the 15 % of between one and three months and the 11 % were more extended .
If the compared with our European neighbours , the French workers not are more that in other areas to catch in disease .
A long study done in 2010 two researchers the CNRS planning that , between 1994 and 2001 , the rate of global lack the work ( therefore reasons of health as of another kind ) , in France , between the 10 % and the 11 % , with to a 20 % and a 28 % in Denmark , a 15 % in UK UK or between a 16 % and a 18 % in the countries Netherlands .
The fraud in the in disease is not especially significant in compared with the work not declared .
The fraud has a reach quite limited .
The forward of the legislation , since 2002 , has caused that controls of the in disease of more of 45 days are .
In 2008 , of 1.5 million of inspections , the CNAM , in a 13 % of the 285.000 by , that in of short a were &quot; gaps or too we &quot; , is say , 37.050 cases .
In the case of the in of more of 45 days , untreated to inspections , was that 11 % of the cases were &quot; rightly or ; a figure that , taking as starting a total of 1.2 million , out to 132.000 .
Por therefore , high a total of 169.000 cases &quot; &quot; between several million of workers a low disease .
Sin doubt , a figure it in compared , example , with the work in black .
According the Member of the UMP Dominique Tian , author of a report on this question in June , this practice will a losses of income tax of between 9.000 and 15.000 million of EUR the year , is say , more that total cost of the benefits in and , doubt , significantly more that fraud in this last area .
Papadémos : Greece must apply a new plan of adjustment
Greece is to laws a new plan of adjustment for getting their economy .

The right this new measures of austerity
Antonis Samaras , the head the group of right , was the Monday their support to the measures already regulatory for try out of the crisis of the debt , but has having that their party not with measures of additional austerity .
&quot; we not .n favour of new measures &quot; , said for a meeting with the Members of their party &quot; new democracy &quot; .
Pointed that was of agreement with the objectives of reduction the deficit and of the debt , so as of fight against the funded , but in against of any policy that fanaticism the economic recovery .
To Olli Rehn , Commissioner European of economic Affairs and monetary , that warned of that IMF and the EU not the also of 8.000 million of necessary EUR a guarantee written the support of all the parties to the measures will , for Samaras has would that their word would enough and that not nothing to cause of the external pressure .
A Committee of experts says that must the euthanasia and the suicide for
The live Canadians denied the death , according that report of the society real of Canada
In on of palliative care , the Committee Waddington that governments , the institutions of assistance health and the doctors for ensure the best care palliative , and not only in the cases of cancer .
The Canadian society lives denied the death .
Of fact , so only 9 % of the Canadians is now to about with their doctor on the conditions in that want die and take provisions to such effect .
Se is of a of the conclusions of a tremendous report of the society real of Canada , that counted with the participation of six experts of various areas , including the favours , the legal and the doctor .
This Committee should the government that are the code criminal of way that to the suicide for and the euthanasia , when the patient with this option and has been who responsible for take the decision .
For start , the experts a recent survey of the Economist chief Unit that quality of the death in 40 countries the world .
Although Canada taken the tenth since , the study out that &quot; the of the death in Canada has led a culture in the people have fear of try the issue of the death &quot; .
With medication or not , the 77 % of the Canadians not have access to care palliative , according show the experts earmarked the society real of Canada .
And , to despite of that majority of the Canadians to die in home , the 68.6 % of them has in the hospital .
In whole , the rate more high in this sense the with Québec , where a 86 % of the deaths is in the hospital .
In what as the delicate issue of the euthanasia and the suicide for , the authors the report came to a conclusions that not line with the position the government Federal , that already has declared that not to are the code criminal in relationship with the euthanasia and the suicide for .
Sin however , according the experts , that also have examined the situation in all the countries where these practices have been or not are a crime criminal , not there no test of that fact of that not are considered a crime criminal not has caused an abuse of their implementation , is say , the use of the euthanasia or the suicide for with people not competent or that not would given their consent .
Jocelyn Downie , the report , tenders yesterday the contrary , more tripping in those countries where not have legalised the euthanasia not the suicide for .
&quot; in Canada Everything the euthanasia , although is clearly illegal &quot; .
&quot; in Canada Everything the suicide for , although is clearly illegal &quot; , it Jocelyn Downie .
The Canadians , favourable to the euthanasia
Remember that 85 % of the Canadians already have also to favour of the euthanasia , since that opinion that would to the people whose death is next alleviate their suffering , according a survey of Angus Reid so in 2010 .
Also , the 66 % believes that fact of legalising the euthanasia not will to understand that life of the people elderly or with has least value .
In as to the people that have the suicide for , the 41 % of the view that not should shot a process against them .
In relationship with the peacekeeping or interruption of the assistance health to a patient , the situation is not so clear , according show the authors the report .

Policy energy :
The facts must assert more that undistorted
If there an issue that not can try taking in account considerations of short term or simply thinking in the emotion , is the policy energy .
The availability and the cost of the electricity on directly in the power purchasing and in the competitiveness of the companies .
Is appropriate an i electoral be the time of think on such issues and on the place of the energy nuclear .
The debate only will useful if investigated the whole of the economic consequences , social and environmental of the options proposals .
The French must resorted their opinion in facts objectives , in rational data .
Now that we 7.000 million of people in the planet , the demographic development some the duplication of the demand we before of 2050 , to least that to a huge part of the population World of an element vital .
The same time , will that admittedly the shortage every time greater of the resources fossil for to have electricity now , forget the need of reduce the emissions of gases of effect greenhouse for fight against the change climate , an issue that has disappeared the ecological debate .
The accident of Fukushima not change none of these parameters .
Por that , Germany it single in their decision of up to the energy nuclear .
That is not the case not of Belgium , that hearing the their to the need of find a capable source of , not of Switzerland , that only has aim central build of last generation .
Por another on , great Britain , Finland , Poland , Republic Czech , countries Netherlands , Sweden , Africa , China , India and Brazil , quote some examples , are forward with determination with their projects .
The States United , their on , after Fukushima you add a unit to their park , the construction of a Central after the accident of Three Mile Island .
If the model German , based in the renewable energy , is in times as example , the reality is in against of such speech .
The election of Berlin is to mean a price of the electricity , a greater on energy the need of gas imported , in particular of Russia , an increase of the emissions of CO2 the construction of central of gas and of coal .
In a months , the harmful effects .
Must on the case of Denmark .
Campeón of Europe in the sector , the which this 30 % of their electricity , also is one of the large users of coal and of gas because to the wind ; this reason , their emissions of CO2 and the price of their electricity are , respectively , a 65 % and a 50 % more high that average European .
Por the contrary , thank to the i of our policy energy , our neighbours a bill of electricity a 40 % higher to the of the who French .
While that in an economy rationalisation the cost of the energy is a factor key of the competitiveness and a guarantee the peacekeeping of the industrial usefulness in the national territory , the French companies benefit of the electricity more cheap of Europe .
Por that reason , any reduction significantly of the energy nuclear contribute a strong takes the price of the electricity , what that realism to the statements on the of our country and the defence of our power purchasing .
Se is of a price that great majority of the French refuse to pay and , of fact , not opposition principle to that kind of energy , according show the surveys .
Remember that policy energy of our country has lost build a industrial sector with 125.000 jobs of work director and 410.000 jobs .
This looking to the export , encompasses a galaxy of specialist in the international markets and that can create jobs not .
If France leave the energy nuclear , contribute the of great part of these SMEs and the loss of the 6.000 million of EUR year in French exports of equipment and nuclear services .
What a EPR designed for work sixty years , when is to the collapse of their manufacturer ?
For right the equation of the energy nuclear , there that admit that not there a source miracle of production of electricity , the as that not there a source .
The development part of Areva of solutions with in emissions of CO2 , nuclear and renewable , shows the nature awareness of the sources of energy .
In the case of the energy nuclear , is essential keep the maximum level of security .
In France , have of an authority of security that has a control narrower and transparent therefore on the central existing as on the construction of Flamanville .
Our equipment , of recognised professionalism , are also obsessed the security .
In a century , the sector nuclear has suffered three serious accidents .
So only one , the of Three Mile Island , in in a operational normal conditions ; not resulted consequences not for the people not for the environment .
In Chernobyl , the accident was the design the overheated and to a human failures .
In Fukushima , some people seem forget that accident was to two natural disasters of a reach unprecedented , that wave the death of tens of thousands of people .
The sector nuclear of this accident , such as what was of the two previous .
Thank to these progress and to a cooperation between the authorities of security , and the operators and French builders and Germans , the EPR is a capable design of to such phenomena .
While what all the players finances that want build a Central , the interruption of their construction in Flamanville would a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF , since that them cease to free for in the leadership in the inevitable development the sector nuclear .
Is essential and legitimate to the best options for our country , but would irresponsible to that taught , the undistorted and the volume a debate so important for the economic situation , social and financial of our country .
The immigration , a burden or an opportunity for the economy ?
The policy of immigration roundly Nicolas Sarkozy has been that since various points of view : the of the services police , judicial and administrative subject to the policy of figures , the doubts of this policy with the status of &quot; country of the rights human &quot; of France .
More recently , is the harassment administrative of the students foreign the has to the headlines , with the Minister of internal ( the newspaper Libération the 23 of May ) of last that France &quot; not needs foreign , workers not &quot; .
Sin however , rarely time analysing since the point of economic view .
The question is that , on this issue , there quite consensus between the left and the right .
In the case of the right , Delors chirac the it in 1976 that &quot; 900.000 unemployed not should be a problem for a country that account with close of two million of workers immigrants &quot; , while that in the left , the tone what Michel Rocard that France &quot; not can done office of whole the misery the world &quot; in 1990 .
The only difference , the degree of generosity
In 2005 , therefore the left as the right the fear to the invasion the national territory a of Poles .
To both both , as that immigrants are a burden for the economy and the society French .
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with the act with regard to the immigrants .
In their programme , François Hollande limited to include , those that will right the &quot; problem of the migration &quot; .
This idea of the immigration as a burden , a problem , perhaps is why , but economically its very face .
Such as guarding the economists salute Goldin and Geoffrey square in a recent labour that sums the knowledge more recent on the immigration ( Exceptional People : How Migration Shaped Our World and Will it Our Future , May of 2011 , Princeton University reporter , 352 . ) , there a broader consensus between the specialists on the positive impact of the flows migratory in the economic growth , the wages and the employment in the countries that receive immigrants .
The restrict of the immigration it the growth and it the employment .
The fears related with the impact of the immigrants based in the idea of that these can replace to the national workers , in particular to the little would , pressing for that reduce their wages .
But the experience shows that , in reality , the immigrants are more well Commission that substitutes of the national workers and use mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment .
The immigrants little would working in sectors that not by to national workers and the more would in dynamic sectors where the training is not the demand of personal .
An positive effect on the wages
The same way a Dr would difficulties for work in a country that have lack of , the national between and immigrants from that arrival of these last chance welcome in the wages and the employment of the national .
Taking in account what previous , Giovanni Peri an increase the 1 % of the flows migratory is a takes of the real wages to long term of between a 0.6 and a 0.9 % .
And , have in account the fact of that diversity that immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and the economic growth ( there a great proportion of awarding Peace Americans and companies as Google , Intel , Paypal , and Yahoo were arrests immigrants ) .
The immigrants also are net taxpayers to the social systems , since that of average a 1 % the budget total in the European countries .
The international organisation the work estimated , example , that in Germany an immigrant that it with an age of 30 years operators a contribution ( income least expenditure ) of 150.000 EUR to the public budgets of average for whole their life .
The principle of their mandate , Nicolas Sarkozy wanted go to to the points of growth that you &quot; with the European &quot; .
These European , that to the immigrants , had exactly the effect reverse .
Europe invented the democracy , only you lack think in a European democracy
The democracy is a well precious , but also fragile .
The continent European should power of this already that , although invented in Athens ago more of two billion years , to what long the century which has suffered the tragedies of the war World , , the Holocaust , the exalted , but also to very in Spain , to Salazar in Portugal , the in Greece .
Some perhaps up that , for that democracy definitely on their enemies , would enough as the vote and the way more direct possible .
We , since Rostopchine &quot; the small &quot; , that was of something thought .
The suffrage universal , although is of a necessary condition for the democracy , is not enough only and even can become in a &quot; instrument of oppression &quot; , as said found the Etienne Vacherot .
Not , the democracy required a more : a space public , a spirit public , values , an organisation , a separation and a control of the powers , an education , go , economic solidarity and social , justice .
The crisis that we in Europe is a economic crisis , but is to point of become in a crisis policy and democratic .
The referendum Greek verdadero-falso had , to this regard , a double effect intend : was the need of a return take of the sphere policy , but also the worrying that of their alternatively , of their inconsistency .
Must on this ambivalence for .
The truth is that lines the with of the democratic battle currently have and that , in many cases , the soldiers Republican already not progress in the good sense .
Not gaining if we a succession of national referenda , organised in role of the needs and of way .
A signing in white the European no or a high the we the hole : ! what options for the citizen !
Not , we not .rom by of effect , but an common exercise , of plenary right , relaxed and continuous , of the options and the democracy , this time to at European .
Not there crisis in Greece , Italy , Spain , Portugal ( of fact , not where end the list ) , because only there a crisis , the crisis of Europe .
The whole of Europe is the to the orders of the markets and of the agencies of rating , that unaccompanied their powerlessness and their lack of solidarity .
Is the whole of Europe the suffering a humiliation in the international sphere .
We into the transfer of sovereignty to Europe , but is whole Europe the lose slowly the sovereignty and , with she , every a of their nations .
What more urgent is that sovereignty popular ’ the helm the project European .
Because only together will the European reduce the weight of their debts , Authorities of the markets and preparation their future by the investments .
The exit of the crisis putting decisions to at European that not will factored a democratic legitimacy total , unless that be for the disaster .
After have fought for a time against this proposal of the socialists and of Delors Delors , all the world calls in the today a economic European governance .
That so be .
But think in she a greater integration policy and democratic , and that be as such the citizens , would a new madness and we would to a new point died .
We in a new stage of the construction European .
For build the Republic in France , was be &quot; to &quot; Republican .
The revolution motivated interests not would enough .
This lesson still being applies .
We build a Europe more integrated since the point of economic view .
Only will achieve build a Europe more democratic in the political level , a real popular European sovereignty .
For build Europe , us European .

The Nord Stream , new door of entry the gas Russian in Europe
The pipeline Nord Stream , that directly Europe Western with Russia happening the Fund the sea Baltic , already has since in service .
Must supply gas for satisfy the needs of thirty million of who .
Gazprom , the heralded Russian the gas , has wanted so the event with great .
The last Tuesday , more of 500 invited , including four Heads of state and of government , took to on the Baltic , between the music of the and a delicate , in the opening the Nord Stream , the new pipeline that directly , under the sea , Russia with Germany .
Symbolically , the Chancellor German withdraw withdraw , the President Russian at indication , the first Minister French François Fillon and their counterpart of the countries Netherlands , Mark Rutte , have together the of the controls the entry of gas Russian in the network of Europe Western .
With this new pipeline , every year that 27.5 million of metres runs of Russian additional gas to Europe Western to through of a first had of 1.224 km that region of St Petersburg with the Land of Mecklemburgo-Pomerania .
A second should to end of 2012 that will supply a total of 55.000 million of metres runs of gas , is say , enough for cover all the consumption French .
Also , already about of the possibility of build a third the same way .
For Gazprom , the completion to time of this huge labour is Buenos of victory .
Poland and the countries Baltic had theories strongly the project .
Of fact , the Nord Stream is to allow supply gas directly to Germany , any the course third earth countries ( Poland and Ukraine ) .
Of coup , these two countries some something of their power : for them , will more difficult influence in Russia with the access to the markets of Europe Western .
In the point the debate , Warsaw not in for the Nord Stream as a &quot; new Pact germano-soviético &quot; , in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for should Poland in 1939 .
Is say , if the issue is politically delicate .
Europe Western , support the project Russian , has successful a greater security of supply .
But the price is a weakening of the Europe of the energy , given that project has led a gap between the European the and the East .
Russia has known , in so only five years , to their vision of an alliance direct between Russia and the countries Western rich , large consumers of gas and with a reserves every time more limited .
&quot; this pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia , a new that we unite of way conventional &quot; , this François Fillon for the opening the pipeline , proving to what point the large contracts the sector the gas are so political as economic .
All this it the broad grins in the sides of the analysts of Gazprom , many in Lubmin , in the point of arrival the gas .
The construction of this pipeline also is an technical achievement .
The is made of steel of cement for against the of the ships .
Se supports in the Fund the sea , to an average of 200 values of depth .
For , was necessary avoid camps of mines that dating of the second war World .
&quot; was necessary with or destroy a of them , caution &quot; , out Jens Müller , spokesman of the society Nord Stream .
Also , necessary s providing the measures of protection of the supervise and the flora .
The is a long word of metal that is as 242 Eiffel and is not interrupted in whole their length : not , not stations of peacekeeping .
Was measures a platform of control in the waters of Sweden , but the responsible the project to the same the see that Swedish not were very prepared to allow a society Russian state of way permanent in the sea with to their as .
&quot; in case of , the step the gas in least of a minute &quot; , precise Jens Müller .
In case of flight , the gas the pipeline , therefore , to the atmosphere .
But the builders they little likely that would a flight , since that have to that , according the forecasts , will a flight every 100.000 years .
The control the state the pipeline does by a robot , a per , that for inspections Foreign , so as by a has that everything the internal the pipeline .
With the way of a pure , introduces in the internal the , that has a distance of a metre , and at with the gas .
To their arrival , after three hours minutes of journey to a at of three second metres , except data precise on possible the metal .
The pipeline has been designed for work for fifty years need of no kind of .
The movement the gas does simply the pressure .
The principle is of 200 and , to the exit of 100 .
Five companies have UK their forces for power to to out this project .
The company leader is Gazprom , that has the 51 % of the financially .
To she , the German E.ON and BASF ( 15.5 % every a ) , so as the noticed Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez ( 9 % every one ) .
These five societies have created a common company , call Nord Stream , committed of build and exploiting the pipeline .
Has their headquarters in Zoug , Switzerland , where the forcing is especially favourable .
After , Gazprom to this society , for a term of there renewable years , the whole of the capacities of transport of gas .
&quot; to Gazprom you in the capacity total , regardless of the amount of gas that really transport &quot; , precise Jens Müller .
The funding of the construction the pipeline has taken just in a 30 % with the contribution of the and in a 70 % by loans banking .
The total cost of the labour should achieve 7.400 million of EUR for the two .
For GDF Suez , example , the investment has reached the 240 million .
But the weaker are insurance of that not their investment , since that Gazprom moderating only the risk of the expenditure .
The pipeline the Baltic in Lubmin , in a at of .
A , with 4.5 metres of all , are the door of exit the gas .
There a sensors that pressure , the temperature and the specific characteristics the gas to the arrival , before of that owed to the pipelines Germans .
Since the last Tuesday , the terminal a million of metres runs of Russian gas every time .
To total capacity , will three million time and in 2012 , six million .

Portugal shows very confidence
The Portugal of Paulo Bento faces with a great optimism the party of back against Bosnia ( 22h00 ) , that will the Tuesday in Lisbon .
In the party of ADI , them missing realism to both equipment .
&quot; when these 90 minutes , be a team happy and , on all , a country happy &quot; .
Paulo Bento already is in Poland and in Ukraine .
Not has no doubt ; the Selecçao , that at since September of 2010 , is to for the football of 2012 .

But there a party that playing and a contravention , Bosnia , that defeat .
Taking in account the party of ADI ( 0-0 ) , the Friday in the hell of Zenica , seems clear that thing is not my .
Portugal delayed the party for more of a time , , but not could usher the valuable that you would given the quiet .
&quot; is a good result , but to the time means a risk , since that we not .here outside of home &quot; .
But in home , in the bright on of the light of Lisbon , the Portuguese are much of that , to a public that should be as of himself , even if is clear that party &quot; is very matched &quot; , a positive Bento but .

&quot; we to playing against a team that has a great technical quality and that at of players with a great individual quality &quot; , added .
The as that in Zenica , the Portuguese Iran with the intention of as , since the principle , a pressure have on the for &quot; not swearing time to think &quot; .
A good idea , always this time , be realistic .
