On on of a child : not and dinner
More of a third of the children with age percentage between the 9 and 13 years have problems of obesity , where the obesity affects the 9 % of the population school and the obesity the 5 % .
The children overweight from in their majority of families with a lifestyle of life that not is healthy , according from of research current .
Again to demonstrate what is the importance the environment where overall for a development healthy of the person , so as the models that serve of reference .
In the table , the children discriminatory , example , of pressed the least with the double of often that children of families with weight normal .
For dinner , more the 19 % of the overweight had potatoes the day before the analysis , the which is linked the programme of prevention &quot; the obesity not is a &quot; .
In the families of children with obesity not there preparation of people sports , what which is applies to the majority of the families current , where only the 15 % of the children replied that their parents , the least a time week , are time for the exercise physical .
Survey so to 900
The survey was to end the last year school and took in the same almost 900 children of education basic of whole keeping .
Already was the second edition the programme of &quot; the obesity of not is a &quot; , that supports the company of sure health general and the company .
To now , have participated in the project more of 12 billion children since the 4º to the 8º course .
A appropriate and quite exercise in family are factors , that do decrease a number of children with obesity and even obesity .
&quot; only the half of the children have would that have five lunches joys according the regime : breakfast , lunch , food , and dinner , that is a of the conditions in for a healthy &quot; , other one of the results of the survey .
Breakfast but with for
The specialists of that , in a development healthy , are important , also , the details , that also have , as example have a time set for the breakfast in family .
In keeping , not however , only the 23 % of the families of schoolchildren to the same time .
In the majority of the families , every one only .
But what worst was be that in the 10 % of the who not nothing .
The breakfast is , however , the basis of a daily right .
The study shows that in the families of children overweight consume with very more often the potatoes .
Almost all - regardless the weight - they to on ( 70 % ) .
Rule general do sport more the 40 % of the children , however , pronounced their parents this result reduces to least of the half , only the 15 % .
Your
The next stage the study that elected ( 204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools ) their own which to from of all the at possible according their tastes and views .
&quot; the preference food of the children czech in age percentage between the 12 and 15 years , since the point of view of a food healthy , are very removed of what ideal . &quot;
Between their food favourite are the meat and the
&quot; is on all alarming the popularity of the &quot; , by in the report end the study .
As food main has the palma the and you still of close the meat of subsiding .
Virtually , the children reject always the and the will the fish and the i is very under .
Change to habits
The same time , the study shows that children are prepared to change their habits food if receive the information fair .
&quot; in the group of control of the participants in the study , that after of end the programme of prevention &quot; the obesity not is a &quot; , was in many cases a change important to favour of the principles of a food healthy &quot; , as in the results the study .
Is the attention , example , what as to the , where many children to the water normal and aware .
The children also with more often in the meat of subsiding and the fish for the food main and the consumption of food fresh and the derivatives of .
The has of be also a good guillermo , maintain the
In the article , how about the , already i a little of that lessons initial already were quite .
Not had not idea of how would for .
Conferences of three professionals the , how tight to eventual problem and , also , a seminar on how works in the world the spectacle .
And will worst .
As more close are the examinations end , more information and tasks practices we
And although the course develops every saturday and sunday , already not is a .
We time we examined with the there , , ( in the course not there no man ) on how tight to the woman that not has a perfect .
And so is the great majority .
Someone is , someone has a on the right and someone suffering obesity .
The has of know arise a shoulders , a bottleneck or the
We have given certain noticed on how to i the body of women the kind of valverde , of and enormous but close and the same time not of a way too
If , example , the difference between the and the is so that skirt or the trousers not , is the it done the least a paper of manipulated to measure .
Doubt not , because the clothes that where perfectly is .
With a skirt to measure relieved a better that with that not for of ! , , in the , etc.
The body can allow tight clothes with , , or .
There certainly many types of information various and of bodies , so that am readjust of that have of whole the week for to order in my head whole this information .
And even so , i fear that with the task , already have more that of too .
To every participant in the course you have allocated two famous , to the must solutions two : one for the day and another for the night .
There that have in account the aspect current , the lifestyle of fashionable that to the person in question .
I has &quot; tight &quot; to kerr , perhaps the of the campaign of victory &apos; at .
Out within , for me is a better that , example , or , that recently will a hundred double ( favour , have in account the excessive ) , or the .
The overalls we that of the weeklies or in internet and , for after wholeheartedly .
The , that is as is the result completely , this also our lifestyle personal and our relationship with the design .
Is important also think in the part the .
The , therefore , not only physically , but that also taken , example , of the pages of products in the weeklies ( of subjects specific , as trends , , coats , etc. ) .
Of all this we spoke the and leather .
But all this already is for the sunday .
The has of have a vision global .
The three invited specialists him the conference the saturday with information on all kind of bodies .
The , the leather of fashionable and the of fashionable ben .
We reminded that fashionable is a illusion and the should from party to this .
And a good know work with a same of tight of forms various .
The is , in this case , fundamental .
So , the such ( or as say in english , trench-coat ) can tight to what hidden with and , but also it for tight the body he with shoes of and as if it in reality a clothing .
Or well enough and higher the bottleneck for obtain a image completely different .
&quot; with this &quot; , we stressed .
What that more is the next council : &quot; for start to work , ago lack that first all the rules &quot; .
&quot; then already now &quot; , said .
End i is clear what all these keep , what being with what , what , if then is that in the weeklies of fashionable we we results different .
That about of the .
Thank the ben , know a has that have more types of clothes in the reserve of the to .
So , for a history of fashionable that have ten pages ( therefore , ten ) , there that have splendid , lists for use , the least fifteen .
And also that photos the clothes works in combination with other , all them different to the mines in the reality .
All this there that times in account to the time of solutions the .
We was that image and the lifestyle excessive them alone , in many cases , the half the success .
Enough look to , that not is precisely a as extraordinary , but the image and the have fact of she a star world .
In keeping , the time , not there still a trend clear to use the services of the .
To the eventual famous also what are pointless ( i mere my skills , my aspect physical not has so importance ) .
And when someone we our services , there that have in account that is very likely that we a stature very different to the their real ( will ) .
Then only is and physically if the weeklies the heart already have writing on the issue , if a certain has / , etc.
The sunday , and we in that not you enough in the fashionable , but that has that understand of .
For their work , on all must communicate with the people to the , what that is fundamental be a good guillermo .
Know appreciate to the people , not ago of least , it their views .
&quot; when a there you for that you the and what with fine , not now catch and throwing all what that had and say : &quot; what horror &quot; &quot; .
&quot; the least a couple of things that and recommend for that someone the can to &quot; , says .
He same also we was that all must in the call &quot; &quot; , is say , the exchange of work .
This set around of the and have there all the tools necessary .
Are items as nail , as nail , , or . there also balance of ( that you it the for the session of photos of products such that or ) , special of of front , if this outside greater ( the and another kind of not are , therefore could damage the fabric ) , or a at of remnant .
For not slogans in the usual and to something in practice , we learned to the of the shoes .
Even for the sessions of photos in the study , in a surface flat , could damage the and a more still the foreign .
And not we more that and .
Not we play the shoes with the nail for not accident .
So that had that be very .
I has given a joy the who my work reserves .
The truth is that not i are very well these skills .
This is only a small part of all the we heard for all the end of week , in the second part the course .
Already i i given account that commit the to level professional not is a way of reflect , but i exactly as what that telling the people .
In at : the competing whole america .

A journey , in principle , complicates to cause of a series of of a journey routine for the question of morning .
In certain measure managed cover the expectations , but this not it of nothing , if , in reality , not intended to nothing so .
The new over , to the title adds the , adherents large expectations already before of their .
That would new buenos to the former of to at and , to as of what shown , is as a at that not should end being other time a gender of action more .
Also we we know how bee the scenes , where the like main falling the car and drunk their own ordinary .
As is happen in the of , the results not vary great thing regard to what that we those .
There to that can to tonnage , but in the total some points to cause of failures absurd , that already come in the series since ago years .
In reality not can not blend errors , but that is more well of the incomprehensible of the .
The adventure starts very well .
You introduces in a history , whose leading , as , has certain problems personal ; for , you offers participate in a career illegal whole america .
You the in the at east , in st which , and excuses mission is to the first to new york .
The idea is offer something interesting .
The route into in ten stages and , then , in more of fifty to .
Of this follows that every career has place a route different and the stages are in different forestry , that are quite various and interesting .
Of that way , one not has not the of that at will always what same .
Some of the forestry are even to the view , although the level technical the is equivalent the of evidence previous of the series .
Therefore , not is nothing the another world .
But the walk the desert , the landscape or the high mountains covered of snow is a effect about very an .
Also , the to of time in when a element .
So , example , in the desert you a storm of bit that ever the visibility .
In change , in the mountains there that have care for that not you a .
According that , every a of the to is very well developed .
Only there a couple of models , but with that enough .
For a time , to a amount of rival ( what normal in a career classical ) , after of earn time ( duel hidden ) and then you expected a duel against a only .
In a of all this is to sometimes the police , that not ago but obstruct still more the things .
The element are the landscape outside the car .
Have when as , in the majority of the cases , has of escape of someone and fine you that , always the fair in the time fair .
Nothing complicated .
Is surprising , however , that has enough least landscape in the at of what that be wait ( in particular there only three ) .
But the result end is positive , because this element not a to be upsetting and , in the context already mentioned , is one of the elements that do that at it more interesting .
The model of underlined still the fingerprinting of the episodes previous .
That to say that to day of today already not be great thing , but not can that be bad .
If a realistic , already now to in other part .
But to a career by with quite action you be quite this lifestyle of underlined , although we find something better between the games of the competition .
To here , all in order .
But the problems arise after of a true time .
To difference of what right of the models of underlined , already not happens what same with the collisions .
Of games of this kind not is wait that and collisions complicated , but of fact before of a coup against any subject , not now predict how prosecution , with what which not all is in order .
Is typical the to a very or able the prosecution with a traffic normal , so only has covered , but in other situations almost identical , prosecution has doing .
Or even has completely destroyed .
Thank the system of , not arise large problems , but can of humour .
The are of such way that , when a accident or you of the back , the at you the last point of rescue in the back .
However , in every career only at of five available .
If the all , you that restart the career since the principle .
So therefore not is more a aid in case of that something not will well , but not is very of .
To sometimes , not the aid , only aid the stage on of memory .
A great disadvantage the at is that ourselves facts are in different places .
In some , example , there that into of a way specific ; of another way , are being of take .
Other sometimes you in some website vehicles &quot; civilians &quot; always with the same configuration , although the first , or five minutes before or after .
This ago of on all in situations , when that two that will the i in directions diametrically , your problems , but when , or well ruthless .
Is as when , because is programmed that &quot; surprise &quot; always will front of release .
The adversaries have also a advantage more .
For whole the starting to websites where , have in account the time , always you the same in the same website .
Also this happens the end of the starting , in a long bridge , what which is still more .
Must to before that fine , the price that be .
When is front of fine , you difficult the vision of the come of with , so that principle now to the car .
Can understand the idea of create a at with maximum takes of and , but the execution is so apparent that surely you delay .
And is a it , because although the model the journey be simple , the at is fun and with action , of way that to often not is possible to the detail what that is not where .
And really as , if the merit has the idea with fifty runs standardise or the classification in the career for that not the platitude , or any other thing .
A idea is the change of for the to .
You that be to to the of petrol the on of the road , because exactly there you that change of prosecution , although in the great majority of the cases you suffice what that you .
The into in three categories .
The sports are suitable for areas urban , the strong americans for the motorways and the for a underlined technical , example , roads of mountain with .
Also balance main also is a balance of challenges parallel , is say , there to in places specific that stories .
Here not only rich , but also points of experience for profile , that it therefore for the challenges as the .
The achieve the level higher , the driver you open several for , beginning the prosecution and with funds for the profile .
The same time , there a role in line , that highlights results with the of other players and other duties community .
One of the elements more difficult of understand is how is nation the last career in the history .
With the car to the tunnel the metre ( pass ) , where you to to to shameful the to ( pass ) .
The you mark between 150 and 200 km / h ( pass ) and , of suddenly , behind you a metre and you has front more .
In the wording surely we a discussion on this for several days , on if for the programming the at none was even a little or if the authors of truth we take a bunch of .
The part technical the at not is nothing so , but the least the effects general are in the majority of the cases , to sometimes to .
Therefore what it that , in the at more reduces the quality of image and , in times , of a way serious .
This affects on all to the accidents where there many participants , when the quality of image continual already not is valid .
The audio is well and the bandwidth is a question of tastes .
To end of that be the welcome to the greater part the group youth , the bandwidth belongs to the category &quot; every one of their father and of their mother &quot; , but can mean that nobody enlightened the at only their music .
The end of at : the is therefore quite confused .
If the at errors absolutely thinks , we we problems in that is the better at of of the last years .
The of that at not is completed .
The is , but because the errors you slap in the eyes with the force of a of airport .

The her to the eu ,
The czech have a ensure of and eurosceptics .
&quot; the treaty of lisbon has affected significantly the balance between the institutions individual &quot;
&quot; not i than a war guardia &quot; .
&quot; estimating five , six years , before of that situation a little , and the new players to their new papers &quot; , so began with conviction their conference in the bioaccumulative of right the her czech to the eu , .
How not factored in seriously their motto &quot; clear and openly on europe &quot; , that said already in the first part of their conference , when managed under every body of the eu and their relations with such precision and clarity , therefore would the of many lecturers of the bioaccumulative of right of the u. .
Also the work of the new president permanent the council european , will rompuy
&quot; what first arise the criticisms , that if is , a official grey , capable of in any role , but i of say that he to all there , because moderating their gender to the mastered &quot; .
&quot; is a man that know listen to the member of the bringing states , communicate with them and that has a vision of towards where must go the eu &quot; .
The new since of representative of the policy foreign and security it to from of the question : &quot; who is this eu ? to what number can ? &quot; . is therefore of a step important towards the unification and the clarification of of the union policy of face to states as china or india .
Nobody to the cheese of
Has occupied also of the agenda was , still and will the council european in the future next .
The presidency czech of ago two years was a success .
The czech dublin of the crisis economic shining , worked the crisis the gas and organised a summit for the partnership eastern .
The fall the government in at time lighthouse as a aspect very negative , that back seriously to keeping .
The representation czech in the eu has the time many commitments .
In words of the her : &quot; a good mighty &quot; , not only the presidency , but also the crisis financial , that is trying now .
Another on , there that approve the budget for seven years of the eu , caused the current situation economic , a more difficult .
If the budget is more simple and effective , what sectors will priority , what countries will greater support and what least ? that is something that will present in the agenda of the next meeting .
The her reminded also their main , with the came to europe : &quot; about of europe with clarity &quot; .
&quot; what true is that not i them the or the people not understand &quot; .
&quot; how can a citizen understand that in brussels not invent of truth the curvature the curvature or , bananas of various sizes or that nobody we is to ban the cheese of ? &quot; .
Also to from more from the environment of the eu and closer to more citizens czech to the institutions european .
We expected the europe of the
According the her , the czech have reputation of eurosceptics and the people is more well the aspects negative that positive .
Also , the low participation of the czech in the institutions european .
The fault is of a of factors , as the of our candidates , their inability for write messages of motivation , but also the little support of the czech .
Also the success of the presidency czech , it of highlighted the force and the collaboration the group of .
&quot; that when who to me a polish and a hungarian and i about a slovak , a french to my on i says : &quot; what , already you been , the group of ? &quot; , and is that not you ago no grace &quot; .
In the future , to the eu , according , you new regulations of policy budgetary for the states member .
Is as something very real the concept of the two part , if not are more , in europe , more that new of &quot; the federation european &quot; .
&quot; we countries in the and countries outside of the &quot; .
&quot; we the space schengen and we also the procedure of cooperation from &quot; .
&quot; said first time that only the countries that want and the not , that outside &quot; .
&quot; these procedures will every time more and reinforced the europe of the two part &quot; , expected .
In this sense , also skills the role of keeping and of will rompuy in the implementation the principle , according the which all the subjects that affect to the whole of the eu must discuss between the states member , not only between the member of the .

Then in their case can say that go of purchases has become in a vice .
Some women are account that should appease their the purchases , what least a little .
But to see , what woman could the temptation of wander more the shops of clothes , to well and after all in the ( in all colours different ) ?
Although for the majority of the women go of purchases is a deregulate , for the men can become virtually in a hell .
Only democrat how sometimes already you has said to their couple that better the front of the door .
The dissatisfaction

The sex strong also is of agreement in that as more is the often of the complaints , more them the women .
The order and the tidying in first

Must the windows , to the soil , validity the dust , the swimming and all that what least two sometimes week .
You to their couple that you has the soil fair with a ordinary dirty , to their children that have persuaded a would rolls and a with doors of glass that therefore you cost must ?
In case of that you this &quot; handicap &quot; , to be aware of that nothing should spared and that order and the tidying surely not should should be in the family .

Such time , if the men the women , their part , not would many comments .
And
To some women them will also the , but also the and the against someone .
The women in the relations , that them like about emis of things the kind who , where , with who , how and what .

With the hand in the heart , this is own of almost all the women .
Another on , there women of these that not monitored , to the them love and what do to often , to all and are dangerous for the around , on all in a team labour female .
And with their to through the
The of hockey part the monday in the i of with two that victory on the 5 : 3 in the of and again to to to the players czech in the forefront of the competition .
In both cases claude availed the ground of the star of 39 years , and was a step more and was declared better player the party .
Two in the party and also the about of , .

&quot; already before the party you had said that would &quot; .
&quot; what &quot; .
&quot; to sometimes seem &quot; , he , after of that their action you a to , to as the first the .
A pink after also the second intervention the team had a trace czech .
Was with the behind of the of the and what between the circles to , that .
A second before of the first pause a player local , patrick , was , but since the principle of the second part already the .
Specifically .
After cooperate with the third , after of that their the fourth of the of .
&quot; i love playing with he &quot; .

&quot; am very pleased of this &quot; .
&quot; i playing for he &quot; .
All these years in the , my colleagues for me , and that now is results &quot; , adds .
Still became the party in a drama , with the of and then of new of , of , to only to a of distance .
Not allowed more complications , although ended overcome in number of two against one .
&quot; had a good action in our field &quot; .
&quot; the , i i at and was towards the part more &quot; .
&quot; of the and am pleased because what distracted &quot; , the last the party such as what lived .
With their victory , has since in head of the conference this .
The ombudsman czech the montreal , , not rugby to the end the party against , in the second third from a injury in the part higher the body .
The not only lost a player with very experience in defence , but also a difference of two goals , 2 : 3 .
Not it take one of the fired .
More that points recovered the you local the great amount of in the last class , and playing the party only with five have .
&quot; that is bad &quot; .
&quot; toy the party only with a player contractor , the rest were &quot; .
&quot; in end , but is that against that not can to nothing , we that with this &quot; , said delors martin .
&quot; therefore to the players the against us , not what we &quot; .
&quot; had that simplify more still the at , from the of our field &quot; .
&quot; and so stop missed &quot; , he one of the have , p. k. .
The played with thirty speeches the in the victory of 5 : 2 on the .
The goals of were defamation five players that put so end to a series of that already five parties .
How have out the prices of the travel since 1989
To 1989 had in the czechoslovakia of then only five agencies of travel state you : , , , and .
The agencies of travel of at time in the majority of the cases travel only the bloc socialist , therefore the travel to west were very .
The tourists czech would , therefore , of holiday to the beaches of the gdr ( republic democratic german ) , to the union soviet , ( in in the sea black ) to bulgaria and romania ( both in the sea black ) and to hungary ( ) .
A exception positive was the period for between 1962 and 1972 , when could travel to yugoslavia , however , after the regime towards the east and the travel of the tourists czech were then quite .
A great somewhat the socialism was the fact that to the citizens the bloc socialist ( or be , also to the ) not them travel free and dreaming not even the countries socialists .
If a citizen wanted travel dreaming , example , to poland or to the union soviet , needed a letter of invitation , if not , the journey individual not was possible .
The agencies of journey in those times also travel the east , but one should to to the eu with a together of ball and to so whole the night , or have &quot; good known &quot; in the agency .
Still so not all was cattle .
The call &quot; promise of change &quot; that was the condition for the travel the east , not to the &quot; people politically little reliable &quot; , that so not could travel in no .
The currency not was a currency freely converted and , guarantee of change , not was possible obtain the resources ( the currency western ) for travel to west .
The great majority of the czech experience their holiday in their own country , what that had a great number of bonemeal and houses of summer , that czech . this preparation still there .
The way of travel of the czech has suffered since 1989 a real revolution .
While that to 1989 for us was the not is more to the holiday in the gdr or bulgaria , the year last the czech did 4.5 million of travel of holiday to countries of all the world .
Is great somewhat , of the today day already not we aware , the fact of that destination currently bookmakers , croatia , to 1989 not could travel freely , because was part of the yugoslavia of then .
To principles of the years 90 imposed the exemption of visa for travel to the states neighbours of europe western , what that resulted a wave huge of visits of short an , to vienna or germany .
The , for a time , not his of the east , all the world wanted it the what least a time .
Example , in paris the groups of czech in the parks in shops of campaign , already that our income of then not we pay a hotel or pension .
A feature typical of the czech of at time was the be for the food ( canned , pressed , etc. ) for save .
Another time important was the introduction of the of the crown czech , so our tourists could finally , after of decades , buy freely currency western .
Our level of life and with he also the wages media , what that around of 1997 resulted a increase in the demand of travel .
With the increase of the demand of travel they the agencies , to from of 1997 with regularly , to preparation the travel using the colleges of flights , what that was down incredibly the prices of the travel in compared with the last , thank to the possibility of obtain discounting the volume of passengers .
To end of the 90 the century last , already the czech found visa to almost all the countries developed , are ee.uu. , what which still more our travel .
Another time interesting in the history the tourism pos-revolucionario happened already in the 2000 , when was organised , thank to a huge demand , the first flight direct since keeping to a country , and was to thailand .
Since at year , proceed all the years flights direct with tourists czech was countries distant and . this winter already directly since keeping to 12 destinations .
The countries the their currently close of 100 billion czech the year .
Another time interesting of this time , that symbolises our development pos-revolucionario , came in the year 2008 .
The 17 of november of 2008 , ee.uu. squeezed the visa for the tourists czech , with what that our country happened to be between the countries more developed the world .
In 2008 the czech , first time in their history , have last more of the half of their holiday in the abroad ( 50.3 % ) and first time in their history , have ecu in travel the abroad more of 15 billion billion czech head , including the expenditure in the website of stay .
Tandare house general ordinary for choose the president , that could end of new in point died .
Since ago almost five months the football czech is president and is likely that successor of safronov as president of the federation czech of ( ) , not not after the call of the next house general extraordinary that will place this thursday in .
Of fact , still not has come to a agreement on the rules of vote to to .
The same , not will vote even for choose between the three candidates .
The interested to the football czech are , and .
To their office in june not before convene to their colleagues with the purpose of find a person strong that deals the football in the future .
However , after of conclude the was , used a controversy between the two of the partnership unable of to to a agreement for decisions a candidate common .
This became in obvious the 16 of september when had that be elected the new president .
The delegates of the house general met in vain in the home national ( ) , on in the area of , because the discussions had blocked and not only in as the method of election .
Not came to no consensus not in as to who in the house general had right to vote - only the representatives legal or also the delegates with a powers .
To from of that time and because to this only point , in a agreement over , supported also the recommendation the institute of state and right , according the which the representation a powers not is possible .
However , the disputes on the code electoral are open .
More light on the situation already not could should not the committee executive that , in their meetings , or extraordinary , all not preah nothing .
The opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a couple of sometimes already , but the point nerve still being the same .
The question is the next : of what way to in the third round for avoid the point died ?
&quot; the dispute this in about to if must to of agreement with the or find another model &quot; , says , one of the three of that , since the direction of the partnership , represents the professional .
According the model proposed in the , in the third round going at candidate that have greater percentage of support in the federation to the which will their candidacy .
The region of czk is ready to to to a compromise for that can earn at candidate with a greater percentage total of votes in both .
The part bohemia , however , which the condition of that winner , according these are , should have the majority of the least two thirds .
&quot; this you , however , the sense to the two rounds previous and completely the concept of system &quot; , so is as understand the concerns of the part , according what which what better would not play the order and vote according the files .
With what said , surprisingly , is of agreement also , although is that regulation electoral established the of all the candidates be more to .
&quot; i like that maximum of agreement with the &quot; .
&quot; for that not no about of the representatives as in the last house general &quot; , says the you of victory , that first time as candidate and that at their comments mainly in against of .
Still being positive .
According he , in decide on the new president and he believes that candidates in the future of way constructive .
&quot; all the with the party of today of our team national in the championship european .
&quot; the football will to be leading , and so more to will &quot; says the representative that of the three candidates has more experience in management the football , therefore to level professional as regional .
Is the more reluctant .
&quot; hope that it to a agreement , but , unfortunately , the situation is a more difficult . &quot;
&quot; not is the conflict between and , but there attempts of the rules to their own convenience . &quot;
&quot; this can have as result a new deadlock of the house general . &quot;
&quot; of all case , hope that band the sense common &quot; , said .
Already not is a time for that all the parties are to a agreement .
Some negotiations had that take in montenegro , but who can know to that start the party if the team of football will completely ?
The air special , in the had that travel to , between other the and , not has out this morning problems technical in prague , taking that other a alternative for carry to part the committee executive the place where will place the party of classification .
The meeting decisive , end , could be the will place to level ministerial , that , according have , will this wednesday .
To , minister of education , young and sports , you like a integrate to the parties divided to the organisation integrating more powerful the country for that it to a agreement .
There a in at : the benefits state , the credibility the football and also the next house general the committee central of the federation the sport ( ) that awareness made of a new direction the sport czech after the problems financial of the home of .
Achieve the presidency , because not is a candidate more appropriate .
If the head of the of , , before of the house general extraordinary the name of a candidate appropriate that all their ideas on the new president of the federation czech of football ( ) , not would as candidate to a since so relevant .
&quot; if would a person appropriate , would fighting she and not i would as candidate to the elections . &quot;
&quot; but to the day of today not has been find a person so &quot; , said for the agency of news czech ( )
What that justifies to to into in the challenge with and is exactly the possibility of block to , the course winner of the elections , that opens the way to the presidency of the federation czech of ( ) .
Also that , in case through , in the office of president only to 2013 , when ground the question of the house general ordinary .
In that office you like see to a expert and good workforce that not is too related with the events fans .
&quot; already i about with some people to the could have in account &quot; .
&quot; for me was a madness hear to some say that in this time not even want identify with the football czech . &quot;
&quot; i like change that vision &quot; , adds .
What that supposed more bother to in this time is the relationship of with the president of the partnership of football regional of polanski , a man with a last controversial , known outside the as a with capacity of influence in the vote of the delegates in the house general .
For is so unacceptable see to at in the presidential .
&quot; in case of that , nazarbayev the status existing and nothing in the football will &quot; .
&quot; with the support of , a man of business ambitious , the football sorry still least from &quot; , said .
Mentions also the fact of that ago a years the name of was related with a usual telephone for the research of a case of corruption , of the which went .
&quot; not know what prestige the football could bring the victory of . &quot;
&quot; and with what eyes we all the uefa and the fifa &quot; , said , that also the with certain caution their statement previous that &quot; the club if become in president &quot; .
In the case of earn the elections the thursday , could be the cooperation with in the future .
Of same opinion is the another candidate , , that has been supported before of the house general of september that end in a .
&quot; he ( ) would the first the solitary &quot; .
&quot; is very capable . &quot;
&quot; i what could imagine , example , as head of the representation &quot; .
&quot; but not as workforce of a partnership &quot; .
&quot; i not the there where not i am capable &quot; , added , that in september very attention support the from of the commission of , potential after .
Accepts that to manage the partnership .
Particularly to their capacities of management of the companies private , therefore since the summer last is also the director that with their support took in may the in first division .
&quot; have force for change some things in the area of football and make to their practice safe . &quot;
&quot; for reduce the influence of some groups of pressure , that probably tend to influence in the decisions the committee refunded and of appeal , have situations unpleasant , said so their towards the president the daniel .
A of the priorities also would the of consolidate the relationship between the and the committee czech , with the aid the which pressure on the leaders political for that socrates more money the sport of the tax of the i .
&quot; is one of the problems key the should conducting the new president . &quot;
&quot; if the tax on the games of gambling , as what the parties political , support their arguments , but , frankly , have that us where is to stop all this money &quot; , out .
, now not has in account even their partnership with the club , although he same says that president of the must be &quot; not she &quot; .
Is to their time related with and with of prague .
&quot; not is ideal . &quot;
&quot; but not see sense the fact of yield preach my actions the club of to other person for then again there after a year and a &quot; , said .
Promised to the new that with the point died of the elections .
Two days before of the house general of the partnership of football one of the candidates to the presidency , , promised that , in case of be elected , coordinating that had a new that definitely for right , in the future , the controversy in as the regulation electoral .
The representative the is positive in as to the meeting of this thursday in , and believes that conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory the team of football .
Already before of the elections not made in september , promised firstly , in case of be elected , precisely in the representation and in custom funds .
Decided participate in the last minute in the last house general , what that be of two months you could go well for defend and it , in a context more broader , their ideas on the management the football .
&quot; the people of all the levels taken the football already ago a time and expected know this thursday the new president . &quot;
&quot; feel that has come the time of that someone the partnership &quot; , think the man that couples mainly with the club of , but that worked in the and in the committee executive of the partnership .
This reason , believes have enough experience for manage the football czech .
Is convinced that behind of the problems current with the elections is the euphoria that hung in the time of safronov .
&quot; unfortunately , in the house general of june were adopted the not were so planned as all thought . &quot;
&quot; if certain interpretations , we a president already since september &quot; , warned .
Exactly the document more important of the partnership aids as for who to the delegates .
&quot; if i president , i what counts as a challenge personal and am now to to in case of that . &quot;
&quot; is a question of principles , the which not we there &quot; , says .
Also , in theory , is not over with their opponents .
Already in the last had your that was mercy with , the respects their training in right , being aware of that their would also their first of .
Already was a time attack to he who , the contrary of , not he pawn with head .
&quot; has more of a year in the world of football , and already has achieved some successes . &quot;
&quot; their attacks but were and very people became amazed the campaign electoral . &quot;
&quot; that many of them on their real nature &quot; , said to their maracaibo , that still being faithful to the statements announced already in september .
Their weapon more powerful is , according he , their knowledge the football , since the sports more in to the with .
This last should be of promotion the football .
&quot; also , right all the arose to cause of the as result the scandal of corruption the year last . &quot;
&quot; immediately after i in the negotiations with the sector public and the private , for ensure that has enough money for all the football &quot; , said ago two months to the candidate of 46 years .
To continuation also promised that their appointment as president the football not no change personal of the .
&quot; would that know first the tasks of every he &quot; , said she to where , after a long period of , has a comprehensible .
To despite of the scenarios doomsday current that to the next house general , he believes that delegates not travel in vain this thursday to .
&quot; if the only point of disagreement will how vote in the third round , doubt what we overcome .
&quot; the football needs credibility , the which will only if end has a leader &quot; , still two days before of the working more decisive in their career of representative , still being positive .
Equally , that under their leadership , the to work with wish .
If in the quarter house general its elected the current of as new president of the partnership of football czech , very people remuneration surely .
Equally that , in case of be elected , hard .
To implement a change systematic and to that member the committee executive are responsible of every area the football dreaming .
Also compromises to resolve the case of the , improve the relations with the uefa and the fifa , to more money for the football and continue with the work on the previous president safronov .
&quot; as president , i like commit completely the football &quot; .
&quot; since the contacts international with the uefa and the fifa to the selection , happening the football professional or the invariably of young of high performance . &quot;
&quot; with this not i say that what would all only &quot; , said in a interview for the .
&quot; am a player of team and i gentleman the powers the committee executive of such way that every member can their to a area taxation . &quot;
&quot; and tasks difficult for that football can , in every one of these , to forward with a momentum &quot; .
&quot; to very people this probably not you , because busies start to work very hard and not only criticise the work of the others &quot; , added .
Because to the atmosphere of criticism in the movement , says that has have the possibility of not stand of new as candidate .
&quot; all know , that work 20 hours joys . &quot;
&quot; but need know that will sense and that not will people behind of my that i – and to every step &quot; , he so the for of their .
&quot; very people i has said that not i asked source , because then choice also the others &quot; .
&quot; is of have faith for not leave so , more &quot; , said .
According say , you justifies also continue the work that already began with .
&quot; for these two years , end a great part the work that not i that now vanish &quot; .
&quot; there processes that had started and that will their effect within of a couple of years and not i like that someone the &quot; , announced concerned the fact of that , if the another candidate , , the situation in the partnership could again to be such as was before of the time of .
&quot; i i in the order , and is something that , in my opinion , not is capable of keep .
&quot; behind of he is on all whole that people that football for that outside only a privileged for a few elected . &quot;
&quot; i can a lot of things , but not the fact of that am to favour of someone . &quot;
&quot; attempt be aim . &quot;
&quot; i to a football for all , because only so well all and not only the elected &quot; , said .
This also the idea that only serious resort the president .
&quot; although some people seeking that what contrary , have in mind to what maximum czk . &quot;
&quot; example , is time of think in the fact of gentleman the second division in a part czech and in other , whose winners to the first division &quot; .
&quot; not would the situation current in the we only three equipment of czk , what that represents a problem for the players young &quot; , said .
Although to the of the elections presidential , president the club , not is of believe in their for of be elected .
&quot; still am have a strong support of the federation czech , the which i was as their of and that know that behind of me there successes clear &quot; , said , whose successes understand the savings of a tens of million of billion of contracts , the negotiations of contracts and the negotiations on the law of the i .
Another on , recognised their part of fault in that federation not is united .
And while civilized that is &quot; for to the confidence in the football czech &quot; , as the another contravention , , as a candidate strong that has something that offer the football .
&quot; nobody can for that was a great work the at year &quot; .
&quot; in the case of that be elected , probably will what that already began safronov and not of way significantly the personal in the committees . &quot;
&quot; not i use that to my favour &quot; , so to their rival .

The threat
After the discovery of &quot; the cell of &quot; , the media of communication turks the state of right german .
A newspaper about of a &quot; ideology bloody &quot; that again to .
The for of eight small employers noticed and greeks between the years 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right .
In turkey and in the population german of origin turkish has reacted with fear and concern to this news .
For many germans of origin turkish which that thought died ago time , since the attacks with way of fires in in november of 1992 and in in may of 1993 , not had happened more episodes of violence with background of extreme right against turks .
Not however , never has questioned that in germany there xenophobia .
The network lb reveals a scale whose dimensions not were , not a least , .
&quot; again to the ideology bloody ? &quot; , the edition internet the newspaper turkish &quot; &quot; .
The newspaper &quot; &quot; the contrary that one of the authors the crime was a – of the office federal of defence of the constitution and shows concerned that authorities german can be involved in the .
The community turkish in germany with , the end of week reminded to the victims of the violence racist with a to the door of .
Two weeks before , the community turkish in berlin with with the political germans and turks in a act formal the fifty anniversary the agreement turco-alemán .
The them it in scene with much colours , as a history with end happy .
The information came to some media turks as a : &quot; the gift german the fifty anniversary &quot; , says the title of a article in the platform turkish of internet &quot; have x &quot; , she the background of the chain of for .
The emission german &quot; &quot; not should in out this connection mental .
&quot; beginning to nostrils &quot; , says the title of the spine of .
That killed were people that their tax and did a important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of germany .
In the body of internet of germans of turkish , the behaviour of the police and their of success in the is very accept .
The authors of that authorities german not have a before suspected in the proving of the .
One shows as least rhetorical in as to the media : &quot; to from of now here lose , to the immigrants not them is more that is and the arms &quot; .
&quot; this will the better &quot; .
&quot; the peace internal of germany on are of the quality of the perverse and of the adequacy of the penalty to whole the network &quot; . , says &quot; &quot; .
What that means that , if the peace internal of germany is in danger , the attacks of and in nineties years .
The image of the ruins the fire of has incident in the transported german and turkish .
No another basin was more clearly to the turks that live here that there a threat concrete and , to the germans , that mistrust and the distance can in the violence .
The attacks the sense of group of the part turkish .
Not repeat the errors the
In the press turkish reputed then mainly the swathes of the policy german after the attacks , denies to visiting to the survivors of .
After the attack with way of fire of sent a of condolences the president turkish and , their minister of affairs foreign , what in the of colony . in their speech what that contribute with the tax the turks of germany .
Is clear how estimated the value of a person according the amount of their tax .
The information current of the media turks again to show what thorough that is , since then , the mistrust of many germans of origin turkish in the legality of this country .
Also the effort of a explanation wider and of a terrorism of extreme right in germany , this time do lack words .
The bank the scandal the shores of
The bank more of europe not is in italy not france , if not in switzerland .
The almost been in in the crisis financial and since then of a crisis to the next .
Now the at a german .
Sure that charisma not what had thought .
After of their witnessed starting of the summit the bank federal , in july through that in 2013 in a new and almost also of witnessed work : president the council administrative the great bank swiss , a and state step in their career .
Charisma am should , commends switzerland their beauty and to the their would acquired strength and is we comments on their future colleagues .
&quot; the transported has achieved a revival &quot; .
&quot; i am cooperate with and &quot; .
In september became clear that all would completely different .
A for financial of the transported in london blackout all the systems of security the bank and 1.7 billion million of eur .
, director general of the transported , a banker not only known in switzerland , had that come .
The president the council administrative of the transported was since then also , and all filed : when a charisma ?
Through that charisma must advise the bank since february of 2012 .
And will office of the presidency the council administrative in may , not to principles of 2013 , as the bank the tuesday .
This is hard for charisma .
Not is banker , more well , professor of economy and and has had a period of globalisation surely necessary .
Of coup ago responsible of the strategy of a bank , that has of again to prove that deserves the title &quot; the greater bank the scandal of europe &quot; since ago time .
A part , the transported is huge , to ago little was the greater administrator of goods world , and other part , since ago years , of a scandal the next .
Nothing , so what seems , you the changed so proud bank swiss .
Started the crisis financial .
The transported had a reputation excellent to 2007 .
The image the administrator of goods swiss and hardest , but also , with objectives ambitious , also wanted be a great number in the banks of investments .
A part , with 1.6 billion of dollars , the transported variety more money of customers wealthiest that any another bank the world .
And other part , as bank of investments in the league of the large banks the world .
This .
Hans , the former banker and of professor of in for many years it : &quot; to my students , always i described to the transported as model of a good bank . &quot;
&quot; since the point of view current , one question : how could ? &quot;
Was in a great mistake .
In the year 2007 went to the light that something went very in the transported .
To in of year , peter , director general , that to then was have as a banker and very intelligent , resigned surprisingly .
Some months after , the reason .
The fund of investments the bank in losses with titles of high risk and had that thousands of million .
For should with the transported announced a of capital of nothing least that of 13 billion million of frf .
For this found investors , course that some with contemptuous to little before : a fund state asian and of singapore and a fund state arab , so , that never had heard their name .
This was only the first coup .
In april of 2008 , .
The bank had that on the loss of thousands of million , , president the council administrative , in 2006 in the second better paid council administrative of switzerland , resigned .
In october of 2008 , she the disaster , in view of their investments wrong , the found in the crisis financial to the collapse and had that be the state .
The bank national values problem to the many thousands of million , the confederation was six thousands of million of frf a sensible converted , by the in the bank .
Whole switzerland was affected , said what dramatic that was this for a country small , if to banks so large .
Finally the sum the balance of the in 2007 was more of five sometimes greater that results economic of switzerland ( see ) .
&quot; not we again to beast to the &quot; , said , expert in .
To the first disaster joined the second .
Few months after , the in a conflict tax with america and was ready to limits the data of the customers wealthiest , that possibly had tax with aid the bank .
Also , whereby a figure of 780 thousands of million of dollars , point of profits of these business with a compensation payment .
With the more or least have helped in the fraud tax .
Vet lost something that had been since always their capital in the competition customers rich : the of discretion .
After the scandal , the secret the bank swiss already not is the same .
To this continued the captain the president of the junta directive and the president the council administrative .
And the displacement of the funds of the customers .
Of this way , in few months the bank lost their credibility in their two sectors central : in the of investments by the speculation flawed and in the administration of goods by the aid the fraud tax .
And fair when readjust to be something more relaxed , fair when i that readjust to this , is this history the for , a for individual 1.7 billion million of eur , before of that bank account of that something was .
And , what seen , this still not works well with the management of risk in the of investments .
&quot; with the case to that controls of risk have changed too little &quot; , says martin , professor of economy and finance in the institute banking of the university of .
The director financial of a great bank german also is sure : &quot; the problem of the is that not dominates the controls of risk &quot; .
What that about the idea of the caution , with the bankers swiss were since ago time , be the watch of the over goods the world : no risk too large , in change , the security the money to the another on of the republic alpine .
The brains of security of the banks swiss were the symbol of the reliability , as and the chocolate genuine .
The central of the in not combating with the buzz the hardest bank private swiss , only is a little greater .
The situation is classical .
The bank has their headquarters main in the street of , that is since the station main directly the shores of , the summits covered of snow of the mountains .
Here the buildings are , the sells are a of the more higher of europe .
Here are as between business traditional swiss as the .
Here they since ago years the banks swiss : since the bank national , happening the palacio of , to the banks private as .
Will in the room of reception of the by a disproportionately door chair .
Within the walls are of , front are large of such , with the logo the bank there a great for indicate the &quot; security &quot; .
The know what that client search here : security .
The two large banks swiss , the and , in some time have the idea the great bank swiss , or the have betrayed , as view the president of a small bank private swiss .
Prefer not read their name in the newspaper , the end and the out ago , as all the bankers swiss , also with the business of both large banks .
The has fact too large , view , mainly in the of investments , where the continental have cattle ground .
There the swiss not had nothing more that say .
&quot; and have have for a time to the our of the continental . &quot;
Of fact , the changed the of investments with , handed their first great proposed and then wine the disaster , no entity financial european had lost therefore money in the high risk as the great bank swiss .
The 15 of october of 2008 , the disaster was clear .
&quot; that wednesday the coalition government the small country of seven million decided the greater operation of rescue in the history of their nation &quot; , says the author in their book &quot; wever ubs-crash &quot; ( &quot; the of the &quot; in spanish ) .
The political granted to 68 thousands of million of frf or approximately 45 thousands of million of eur for save the great bank of the .
How them happens ?
About with the bankers swiss , so are the problem in the dimension of the .
In june of 1998 , two of the three large banks swiss in a consortium .
From a bank that , because to the merger , was too large for the small switzerland , and still growing .
What that was for that two different banks precursors of the : a bank puerto but asserts with the centre of the administration of goods in and a more poor but more strong .
Of suddenly , the banks of investment came of way have with a money , with the could to a great bicycle financial .
There two names related with this takes of the : peter , head the consortium of the of 2001 to 2007 , and , then president the council administrative .
&quot; always thought that and were a team perfect &quot; , says the expert in hans .
&quot; , the intellectual , modest , that understand a of models and statistics , and , the managed showed step since the learning in the bank to the summit . &quot;
Finally , of .
And the end was probably a mistake decisive : &quot; was that their models were a reality &quot; , says .
&quot; is a case tragic . &quot;
Tragic , perhaps .
Is clear : the came before the case .
The employees of the remember clearly of the meetings of analysts , in the head the consortium , always the same motto : down the seat to sink sachs .
The bank american was the bank of investment more the world .
The &quot; &quot; , the then the success of the banks .
The wanted be in the summit .
Some steps you forthcoming well .
In the operations of and in the negotiating of actions was in what more high .
However , the net of companies makers put of highlighted a point weak : in the business the interest international , in the language of &quot; &quot; , there a compensation huge for the large banks .
The has in the products americans .
For fill these , the started a adventure that almost you costs their existence .
Of growth , therefore the same bank as one of their funds of high risk created in investments american of high risk .
Transformed in a machine powerful for appropriations americans and to continuation , certain risks to account own .
And also , as other banks at the for a time .
&quot; in summer of 2007 , as the market estate american was in , the there &quot; , said , expert in .
So large the euphoria , so thorough the fall .
A workforce had that go , already that attempt of one s more complicated of what that were .
The jobs in the became in seats and are to the today .
Currently , who at a great bank , has a work almost impossible .
Must find a strategy for a bank , to the all the models of business are stumbling .
, expert in banks , has a idea , to end to the of investments , focus in the administration of goods , return to the roots .
The bank not to to so far ( still ) .
But the of investments must decrease a , is clear currently .
The next thursday , , the new president the bank , will their future strategy the world .
In reality , only was in the italiano-suizo of 51 years as a solution objective , already that bank the bank surprisingly of their predecessor .
Meantime , he imposed : must you of way permanent the business of the bank of the tuesday .
To restore the bank of investment to their state to in of the nineties .
Makes 3.500 jobs .
But this not enough .
The needs a vision .
Who is ?
With what to earn money ?
These are the questions that sure ago charisma currently .
To the time only says that first a housing with their woman in .
The next year .

The demand include the sr. and the department of education of the city as accused , and account with eight workers dismissed as advice , all them women this or , the as that majority of the assistants that lost their jobs .
He , spokesman the department legal of the city , said that city not had seen the demand and what therefore not could to comments on their claims specific .
According a draft of the demand successful the chosen york times , the seconded has focused in the number of redundancies in the schools of areas poor of the city for support a complaint treatment unfair , saying that schools poor lost more assistants , already that had been contrary of way of .
Out that if well not there redundancies in and a few redundancies in the schools in the crisis or , 17 assistants schoolchildren lost their jobs in the district 23 in , , and 46 were dismissed in the districts 8 and 9 in the southern the .
Taking in account the loss of five of the eight assistants employees the school public 36 in , where the 68 cent of the students live in the poverty , the demand says , &quot; this not is a area of parents wealthiest that they custom funds for cover the deficit budgetary &quot; .
P.d. the budget the district 36 reduced in a 3.26 cent this year , and also lost money when the city changed the way in that estimated the funding additional for every abolition student poor in the schools .
The seconded also says that directors of schools imperative can have been unaware the language in that forming the learn of the coordinators of parents .
The his the word &quot; surplus &quot; for under the action , to despite of that &quot; surplus &quot; describes with greater often the act of enterprises to a master of the of a school to a exchange of work , whose just are paid the office central .
&quot; sixty and six coordinators of parents were dismissed &quot; , says the draft of the complaint , &quot; and not only in surplus &quot; .
Mission despite , the congress prepared for to to a agreement on
Seems that finally republican and democrats in the are prepared to only of agreement on something related with the embargo in libya .
All what that needed was that which had success , that contractor dictator the gaddafi outside apprehended and murdered and the participation of states united came to their end .
The tuesday , the committee of affairs foreign the senate is to be a resolution , the president john ( democrat ) , with with the john ( arizona ) and i. ( independent ) , to the who their successful which and to the troops of ee.uu. their &quot; courage &quot; .
&quot; this resolution is for to the of libya , the start to rebuild their country &quot; , said .
&quot; is a claim of support for their aspirations democratic . &quot;
The language can appear , but nothing on the debate on libya has been easy to now .
This summer , the legislators of both parties between and with the home white on the wording of a series of resolutions for approve or reject the role of the military of ee.uu. in the mission of the nato in libya .
In june , and tabled a resolution that forming the use limited of forces military of ee.uu. in libya .
The project of law was in the house a broader for , and that never came to in the senate .
But the same day in that project of law was rejected in the house , the house also rejected a measure that would the funds for the operations americans in libya .
For he the mission of ee.uu. in a kind of purgatory legislative - with the congress what enough upsetting as for criticise the within part of obama of the mission , but not so as for in reality the under their feet .
To continuation , the congress was the events .
Fell in hands of the rebels who in august , and gaddafi was murdered the 20 of october .
The mission of the nato end officially the 31 of october .
Now the senate could be completed for act .
The resolution the committee of affairs foreign &quot; welcomes the people of libya their courage and extraordinary resistance for authorities to ourselves &quot; and &quot; commends to the men and women of the forces armed of states united and to their partners of the coalition that took in operations military for protect the people of libya their extraordinary courage and professionalism &quot; .
The resolution also &quot; states the interest national of the states united in a successful and irreversible transition towards the democracy in libya . &quot;
Going the new measure the completely support of the commission of affairs foreign , or to the legislators as was the project of law of june ?
The last version was rejected the senator richard g. place ( ) , the main the committee .
The spokesman of place said the monday that not had seen still the version end the new project of law .
The another on the house is to vote this week on a amendment constitutional demanding a budget employee , a priority legislative for almost all the republican and some democrats .
The measure , the geldof ( prominent ) , will the first amendment constitutional on the budget or any another issue that of fact a vote of whole the house in the house or the senate in this congress .
Other legislators not have had success to the time for to to their amendments to the house , but not lack of attempts .
The of is only a of the 68 amendments constitutional that have wonderful in this congress , a wider range of subjects .
Some are - the same project of law proposes therefore in the house as in the senate - and other with small shift between .
There what least 15 versions of the amendment the balance budgetary so only in the house , and another handful that &quot; be the expenditure federal . &quot;
Some of these projects of law also are between , but are to their - on all republican job that for their - the opportunity of of that them were the &quot; authors &quot; of this measure .
The law of control of budget , that was adopted in august , that therefore the house as the senate voted a amendment the balance budgetary .
In march , 58 voted to favour of a resolution not binding that supports the idea of that amendment .
More beyond the budget , several member want limit the number of that member the congress can to , while that representative josé e. ( democrat new york ) , to validity the limit of two for the presidents .
The representative l. jackson . ( democrat illinois ) has proposed a series of amendments an right to a education of quality and attention health , between other subjects .
A amendment that prohibits the marriage homosexual is a proposal , so as that prohibits the burning of flags .
Some legislators also want allow the seeking of the laws federal if are been two thirds of the states .
So enthusiasts that have been the member to the time of propose amendments , not are strings to a pace more quickly that in years previous .
In the 111º congress , the legislators proposed 77 amendments , and tabled 66 in the 110º .
The pace is unacceptable in compared with the of the of 1990 , when the member were regularly more of 150 amendments every two years , according figures the library the senate .
But not had a more success then of what that what have now .
The last amendment that added - the 27 - was resting in 1992 , but of fact was proposal the congress in 1789 .

The troops do feel more that
The event was a by of wall the million of dollars for the home in new york .
Rock sung a on the powerlessness , the frustration and the loss .
In that time , several hundreds of soldiers , sailors , and of marina jaramillo in their jobs in about to he .
The of though it of ordinary and .
&quot; the men and women were who as heroes &quot; , said david , who organised the revenues of funds of spring .
A official military of high they in the by , also known as the then president the state greater whole , the , was the role of the troops of way different .
&quot; the were as a kind of child &quot; , wrote the official in a email electronic .
Am sure of that organizers they good intentions .
That they .
But not was respect , of truth . was .
The from at incompatibility the difficult relationship that has helplessness of the military and a public us to often , to sometimes , .
To the troops with praise their sacrifices .
But the has a price , say the member the service .
The public every time more it as if you it those .
&quot; not we victims in no &quot; , said the general of brigade are b. , who the troops in iraq and soon towards afghanistan .
&quot; but seems that only way of that some demonstrate their support is put to us in the role of souls . &quot;
The issue is a issue very sensitive for the leaders military , that not want appear or in disagreement with the public the serve .
Also are account of that ira to the troops that were in the last years of the war of vietnam was a worst .
As result , the majority of the discussions on the have to out in silence and in private between the of war .
After of that their two children were of combat with the of marina , the colonel withdrawn mark them warned of that people from of the military considered their service since two prospects .
Some them with a sense of fear because to that to the insurgents and they to places .
Other if would a &quot; contractor and turn below of the surface &quot; , said , that fought in iraq and came to a work of high level the government in washington .
For their for of employment , said , felt that some you had was if would capable of under the pressure of a assignment work of washington immediately after of their this of combat .
&quot; when about of your service , to with to the from negative &quot; , reminded to their children .
From the concern military , in part , of the fighters us towards the wars .
The achievements in the field of battle are rarely time elected for the part of a country that has little with the military and is few profits direct of the wars of iraq and afghanistan .
&quot; us , as nation , already not we the military of ways that were the all common in the second war world &quot; , said the deputy general withdrawn david , who the troops of ee.uu. in afghanistan .
In change , the praise of the political and the public concentrate in great measure in the depth the suffering of a member the service .
The troops are recognised the number of that have , the number of friends that have lost or the reach of their injury .
The army a growing pressure for end with the
This week , a hearing historic decide if 28 women and men have a case against the army their conciliation passivity to the violation .
If not , hundreds of advice are organising for the next .

He you asked if could joining to she in their room for take a world .
&quot; a signal of alarm &quot; , says .
However , the of texas he to a on their concern .
Thought , not , has 19 .
&quot; is of texas &quot; , says .
&quot; may would heard to my prompts . &quot;
To the few minutes of into in the room of , the man you behind , towards from and , referendums .
This week , the 18 of november , and other 27 member the personal military current and old expect a decision legal in a trial historic that will in , prominent , that decide if the demand that have against the of defence robert garage and their predecessor , , fare to trial .
The demand referendums that garage and top in the reduction of the violation widespread between the military , in violation of the rights constitutional of the soldiers .
A in february , a who of washington , d.c. , the demand discussed at to 17 advice , but to 28 in the months following , 25 women and three men , all them claim that were or sexually their colleagues , and that army owned to the time of with , assertion , or offence justice appropriate after of the subjected .
Says that is to the flat greater the army , because the problem beginning with them .
&quot; the army is a structure of down towards from &quot; , says .
&quot; who are the people that are in conditions of eradicate the culture of the ? the high was . &quot;
Also says that since february , have since in contact with she close of 400 survivors more , many of the which could be part of future demands .
Their strategy : in place of consecutively to all the advice in this case , by all the eggs in a same basket , so say , is to it several cases , of be necessary , for keep the pressure .
The team of the defence for the department of defence , the tax federal voyager , has tabled a motion for underestimating the case .
The documents the court , and , detailed the strategy of defence -en essence , that military not can be soldiers current or old the injury subjected in the forces armed .
A ruling the court supreme of 1950 call the entailed , the government federal not is responsible the damage the personal in service active .
&quot; the damage are part the service military of the advice &quot; , say the documents .
The department of defence refused to to comments for this article .
The things have changed since the years 50 .
While that to the women still them is officially ban serve in combat , this distinction is only roll : the wars modern rarely time have clear the lines the with .
Therefore in iraq as in afghanistan , the equipment of women bronze are papers every time more important , especially for to to the women local in areas of war .
The result : between these two wars , 150 women bronze have died and two thirds of them in situations of combat .
Is time of that army also , says .
She not is single in their fight , and other three demands are in , also the their .
In the bioaccumulative of right of , the clinic of services legal for is about a case against the four main academies military supposed promote a environment .
Other part , the organisation mind of profit vietnam of america is his demand against the army that on in the verdicts of &quot; nuisance of the status &quot; allocated to the victims of violation with the end of them the high the service -un basin common , according the activists , as of the network of action of women in service , a group of rights human .
Their group presented a demand in december against the administration of , of practices discriminates in the way in that attacked the complaints of profits for the people that say have been sexually in the service .
Have tabled nine projects of law separate in the congress part of a of and representatives , for a series of votes .
In 2010 there 3.158 subjected sexual , according the office for the prevention of the aggression sexual and answer the department of defence .
However , the subjected are a , and the own estimates the pentagon , that figure in approximately the 13.5 cent of the 19000 incidents ladies that there that year .
The report , published in march , also distribution the we of prosecution : in 2010 , a 20 cent of the cases in the army was to trial - the half that in the system of justice civil .
The advice in the case of , their attacks as only the first of a series of there .
In the case of , deplored the violation to the police military least of a time after of that .
That night , says , you asked that details of their violation 11 sometimes various to a of police , doctors , and staff .
She concluded to a of violation , and the blood of their -de a court in their brazo- was karl in their bed .
Six months after , in april of 2009 , relocation to a hearing to a judge , for the which you asked about of that would had relations sexual with their the day the attack .
Six people they as witnessing of status in name the alleged author , that was finally .
&quot; remember the day in that surján the verdict &quot; , says .
&quot; thought that i was to go the work -me i shouting since the room . &quot;
&quot; i put in the unit of , and when i , remember that you i to my official of was , &quot; &quot; that not was their trial . that was my trial &quot; .
To you warrant visiting to a military , that finally you worker a nuisance of the status , what that was not for the service .
In january of 2010 was the service under terms menos-que-honorables , what that you from receive any benefit .
In as to if the case tabled and their colleagues of demand continues , is a possibility very well , says john , professor of right in the bioaccumulative of right george washington .
However , out , &quot; in my opinion , should be able of to forward &quot; .
What that between them and a verdict is this entailed that has been since that published first time .
I been a critical permanent of the entailed .
The army is decades behind because not has the same incentive and deterrent that with the responsibility .
And adds : &quot; the back are are in against of them ... but is important for them try . &quot;
These things only period when the people good is ready to fight .
If the hearing not is their way , , who of the advice , will to the eu to their other hundreds of advice for cases future .
&quot; we to to fighting against the army in this issue to that reform would &quot; , says .
&quot; or to that we , what that happen first .
The walls have eyes : how the researchers you are at in
Before of become in the new face of the extreme right in europe , therapy was simply another kind that their points of view anti-inmigración in line .
The monday , , who befriended have done a killing in norway in july , that he 77 dead , brigades to their first hearing legal public .
While can have action only , was far of be only in the : had last the greater part the time that preceded to their attack with to their computer , with some of the million of nationalists that support to the groups of right in networks social .
After of the tragedy of this summer , the researchers wanted know more about of these people .
But , how ?
Easy - only you that into in facebook .
&quot; we we account of that not was so difficult to to them &quot; , says , author main of a report published recently on the populism digital european the centre of studies british let .
The of information personal of facebook is so , says , that researchers could simply use the tool of advertising for determine their characteristics with a precision scientific - the way that sellers have state being for years .
The team of found a million of fan of the groups of right in whole europe and then them announcements , but in place of to a new bandwidth or product of , the announcements to the users to complete a survey that he on their level education , attitudes towards the violence and the optimism on their own future .
The to to through of facebook , and their colleagues were able of to to more of 10.000 followers of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 countries european - all out of the office .
&quot; is a way completely new of to a research &quot; , says .
Some of the results not are the all surprising : the supporters in line of the groups of right tend to be young , men and the immigration .
However , in a kind of drawing , &quot; those that combined their in line with the outside of line are more reasonable , more democratic and least violent that those that are behind of the screen the computer &quot; .
The work of let is only a example of how facebook is becoming in a new and important tool in hands of the scientists .
Centres of research , researchers doctors and scientists political are being the website for to all , since problems of health to trends social such as consent in the &quot; i like &quot; , messages in the walls and dialogues of state .
With more of 800 million of users active a average of three parts of content the day , the &quot; of data &quot; of facebook is and a on of the research , pushing the number of jobs academic with the name the website in the title to almost a 800 % in the last five years .
For some researchers , the beauty of facebook is that you allows to to the people to the not with a in the street .
&quot; before , when to people the party national british , was very difficult . &quot;
&quot; that go to through the party , and them never you creation the access &quot; , says .
&quot; facebook would all that - you to them directly . &quot;
Other say that website could provide a way of identify and address the problems of salud-social .
A study recent done the seaside , of the university of wisconsin-madison and their colleagues , found that students it that they of their of in facebook they a risk significantly greater of have problems with the drink that students that refused in silence on the issue .
Seaside suggests that colleagues of the students , such as the dispatches , could control the website and intervene for help to a student that requires too dialogues of state with their binge .
&quot; not you try a problem if not what you &quot; , said dimitri , the co-autor of seaside and director the centre of health , behaviour and development the child in the institute of research child of seattle , said the washington ex .
&quot; we found a way of identify children in risk that of another way not would . &quot;
Facebook also is constantly &quot; &quot; to their own population for obtain data .
The team of data the website has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and the day of st on , the expectation of participation electoral to half the period legislative of 2010 , and a rate of Škottová national ( mainly being the information to the can access - defenders of the freedom digital ago a time that maintain that website should to to available of other their great amount of data for the research ) .
However , the users of facebook know that website them is looking , them whether or not - the power playing the with a friend to thousands of kilometres of distance is allow that website your information personal .
But what is when the users of facebook spend to be part of a survey that not even know ?
While that researchers have guidelines well defined on how up their data outside of line , in line is a free for all .
&quot; not i that many of the users have thought even in the fact of a scientists could be examining their profiles &quot; , says voyager , a todd the laboratory of knowledge of london , on a study of 2006 that was to out with the walls public of facebook of students .
&quot; in what that to them precise , was only between them and their friends . &quot;
Then is the question of the methodology .
Even outside of line , not there guarantee of a issue of research this being completely honest .
In facebook , is impossible know that part of the information the profile of a user and of the messages the wall are truth .
&quot; what that in facebook and what that pensioner outside of facebook are two things completely different &quot; , says .
Is that , to despite of their years as scientists of the technology , believes a and a are being the best tools of research that nobody can use .
&quot; not there substitute for into in the world real and about with the people real &quot; , says .
&quot; the research social is that is on what social - and a lot of what social still is outside of line . &quot;
&quot; cold and inhuman : therapy ago their first emergence public in the
Therapy , the man that be the which of the two attacks that killed to 77 people in norway this summer , has to to same as a of the &quot; resistance &quot; for their first emergence public in the court of oslo .
&quot; am a commander military in the movement of resistance norwegian and in the gentlemen of norway &quot; , said to a room full with 500 people .
&quot; i am the court , already that received the mandate of the organisations that support the ideology the hatred and because supports the . &quot;
&quot; i the facts but not i adjourned guilty . &quot;
The judge was to for that , because &quot; not wanted to to the opportunity of use this hearing as a platform for that their points of view &quot; .
The same reason refused to allow to , that brought a speech writing with early , address to the family of their victims the end of the hearing .
Also warrant to the police keep to under custody for 12 weeks more , you banned the access to the media of communication for four weeks , and said that authorities should that have a narrower control on all the visits and the for eight weeks .
Around of 30 survivors and family of the victims speakers to the hearing .
Some as with the hope of look to to the eyes , other for confirm that is under key .
All speakers with the aim of move towards the conclusion .
&quot; thought that seemed cold and inhuman &quot; , said a of to the outlet norway .
&quot; was you , but for me was a step forward after of see and hear the suspect . &quot;
Clothing with a suit dark and i blue , remained and professional to what long of the hearing and to the journalists and to the survivors to the eyes when been and went the building .
To despite of the strange notion of of be part of a movement of &quot; resistance &quot; greater , the judge that not is a ill mental , and said that not there evidence of that act with .
Is possible that to some them that attacks the 22 of july unimaginable be labour of a in place of a group of radical .
But that not automatically the pain and the confusion that whole a nation still feel .
&quot; i like that prompt a monster , but not what seems &quot; , said a family of a victim .
&quot; would a more easy if what prompt . &quot;
7 lessons of the interview delayed of , show in a theatre this
After the death of , the 5 of october , there some that what with ford - the out of the technology as the great modern .

For someone known the interviews in depth , here seems surprisingly now to forward their infinite and strategies trade .
And very .
In four points different to what long of the interview , there large between the questions and the answers - of 10 to 15 seconds of , where is clearly their thoughts , for precision .
Also there at in the of its to the surface , where seems because to the questions of , to go more quickly towards the subjects or arguments of greater importance .
Before of the was of , the or the , there something in the interview delayed , when what that is that other companies do well and , and offers their own vision the future of the is .
A thing is read assessments of the career of , but there something oil and in the we here , the on of the greatness .
He has a vision of as can and must be the things .
Not a after of all with detail here , was and what was .
A quickly short of seven triumphs of the interview delayed
On how to to a business
&quot; to what long of the years in the business , i always he : &quot; &quot; what pensioner things ? &quot; and the answers that you are of way are : &quot; oh , that is only the way as ago &quot; .
Nobody know what ago what that ago , in the business nobody think in the things very deeply .
That is what that i .
Has the detail their efforts for simplify the accounting of .
The way in the costs - to often beginning with a &quot; cost standard &quot; that was to eye of good , and that then position with a &quot; one &quot; - developed a factory that could determine the costs trade the detail .
On the joke the pope
The &quot; box blue &quot; that he same was with - a has that did to the people effectively the company telephone and to on to long distance free .
Has writing this about the has , but the euphoria of here the under the box blue as a act of is .
Describes how he and the box by the use of a telephone public , doing a call , and then since a network of &amp; ts to other , while a with the greater amount of satellites possible .
&quot; were the things around the world a average dozen of sometimes and to through the telephone public and readjust a minute more later the telephone public of the door of the on &quot; , says with a .
&quot; distinguished young and what that learn was that we build something us ourselves that could control thousands of million of dollars in infrastructure in all the world . &quot;
Us two , not knew a , but we build a thing small that could control a thing heralded - was a lesson incredible , and not i that never would been she .
Continues a joke that he and almost record , the heavenly to through of the box blue in half of the night and requesting about with the pope , while was their better imitation of kissinger .
To measure that several member of the hierarchy catholic were in half of the night for about with the diplomatic us , the two in fair before of that pope outside foul for go to answer the telephone .
On of the technology ( and the sale telephone with garage )
To the age of 12 years , to the hunting of parts of spare for build a of often , at to garage in the on telephone and you was a call .
Little after of their conversation telephone of 20 minutes , managed a employment of summer to time over in hewlett-packard .
&quot; that was a remarkable influence on me , was the only company that had seen to that age and formed my vision of what that was a company and what well that to their employees . &quot;
Became after in one of the employees of that they the laboratories of research of the company in high , where was &quot; the first computer of table never fact &quot; .
Was so large as a gdr , had a small screen of , and i of he .
A journey to as girl and lose the time with that machine and programmes for she .

Soon in their career , already that he to sell a handful of rachinel basis , you asked a client if could they all the team .
Working with only 30 days of credit , had that physically the and the over of the equipment .
More later , while was in , reminds the struggles to the brigades in the development of a of computer
&quot; i agreement of have arguments dramatic ... i that be five years &#91; for create that 300 dollars &#93; , and i and i i outside and i a leather .
Nineties days after , had that we build 15 dollars and that was completely reliable .
On the large companies losing force
A before of that you of , foresaw the way in that many leaders of the industry in their vision , and the control of their share of market .

And he with the rival of the law of assistance health while the court on the
The day that court by met to door closed for at the question politically controversial of if the challenge to the law of assistance health the president obama , two of their officers , and he , were in a dinner the signing of lawyers that case to the high court .
The occasion was the last thursday , when the nine judges met in a hearing preliminary for to which the petitions of review .
One of the cases in question was a demand a 26 states defiance the reform total of the assistance health adopted the congress the year last , a law that has been a out of war for the activists conservatives in all the country .
The officers admit to impossible the demand and , of fact , expected a plea historic of 5 hours and average for march , and the result probably still more the career presidential of 2012 , that will in plenary of in the time in that decision the court man .
The lawyer that to the court and that law must be will probably paul , who was as tax general of ee.uu. for the government of george w. bush .
The signing of lawyers of , , was a of the almost two dozens of companies that to the dinner annual of the society federal , a group that has many years into to the defence of the principles legal conservatives .
Other signing that dinner , , represents to a of the associations trade that law , the federation national of business independent .
Another was the heralded . , that has a huge interest financial in the result the dispute .
The dinner took in a hotel of washington , hours after of the hearing preliminary the court on the case .
Between the assistants was , between other , hurricane , the more important in the senate and a maracaibo declared of the law of assistance health .
The invited special in the dinner ? and he .
Not is nothing new : the two judges have state factual to events of the society federal for years .
And not is something that between in conflict with the rules ethical .
Of fact , the judges are the code of for that applied the actions of the officers federal lower .
If not what they , could said that under the code 4c , that says : &quot; a judge can attend to events for custom funds of organisations relating with the law and other , although the judge not can be a speaker , a invited of honour , or put in the programme of such event . &quot;
However , the absolute of and he to two of the of lawyers in the case , so as to a company with a huge interest financial , was enough for to the activists of ethical in the government .
&quot; this impressive gap of the ethical and fighters towards the code is in against of the demands of several officers that by the court the same rules that apply to all the judges federal &quot; , said geldof karadzic , the president of ( cause common ) .
&quot; the judges were in a revenues of funds of by with lawyers that have cases outstanding to the court . &quot;
Their emergence and assistance in the revenues of funds for this event undermines any demand of influences , and is unacceptable .
And he have shown little interest the criticisms that say that too easily the activity the court with the agenda groups as the society federal .
And the wife of he , , is a excel encountered conservative .
Other part , the conservatives argue that is the sakharov , the has a problem favours , not and he .
Worked as general of the administration obama when tabled the first challenges legal to the law in the court of first ultimately .
Their critical have preferred for that renewing of see the case , saying that was too in defend the law as for now be neutral .

As detect a
A iris to the headlines more recent we that virtuous serious and curse are the deception and the lie in the life daily .
The candidate presidential is occupied accusations of harassment sexual with several women ; every part accused of lie to the other .
The administrators of the university state of pennsylvania have been accused of supposed conceal reports that were a you of football withdrawn was sexually to children .
The week last , the president french , claus sarkozy , was &quot; &quot; with a microphone open saying the president of ee.uu. , barack obama , that first minister israeli benjamin netanyahu is a do .
Lie has destroyed to and countries .
The new york and in internet , , was the ourselves with their quickly the test .
The former candidate presidential john has been accused of breaches in the funding of the campaign relating with the of a relationship .
And , of new , nobody that what never the circus up the president garage clinton the lie for their second mandate about of their relationship sexual with .
Are very the myths on the traps in the examinations of the school and the university .
Have given cases in the teachers have given the answers of the examinations to the students with the end of be better seen in their assessments of performance .
That should be what contrary are sending the message of that lie and is are tonnage .
How deception we we ?
In a day who , the studies show that you can lie in any place of 10 to 200 sometimes .
That sure , many of these lies are lies .
Another study was that issue three sometimes in the first 10 minutes of .
Detect lies , or &quot; the which of lies &quot; , is a as essential that we acquire all , reasons therefore personal as professionals .
Far of be a at of table similar to , example , , where the aim is : &quot; you have &quot; , the detection the deception is a knowledge serious based in data scientists and for the last six decades in universities that held projects of research in depth , especially in and .
One of the results of the research is that old about of the lie have been .
The who to the eyes .
Not always , , or .
Not can conclude not that are difficult of detect or unmasked .
A of lies trained can to to the truth to about of the structure of the statement , the training of questions and the times .
I several years the scientists on the deception in the spectre and always shining body the knowledge , and was clear that detection the deception is a technical modern that is easy of learn and aid to friend our complex world - especially if their responsibilities professionals include the procurement , interviews , or the management of negotiations .
The good have the as of read well to the others , precise feel to will , their own emotion and of way how the were the others .
We the research that more that men say more &quot; lies win towards ourselves &quot; , while that women say more lies &quot; win towards the others &quot; -- normally for protect the feelings of someone -- that people married least responding to their partners that people that not are married ( but the lies that usually say tend to be &quot; enormous &quot; ) .
Also we that if you is medina as the others least guilty the .
How know if someone is ?
First , rescindable the for her the taxed .
This is &quot; create a line of basis &quot; .
Aid to provide points of reference for measure after the changes .
Rescindable the position the taxed , and feature blues .
Is better that will if someone normally with the ordinary all the time for not to accusations upon when you see the feet in half of the meeting .
To continuation , groups of behaviour dull , and not .
Unpleasant to these groups of behaviour as signals of alarm , not as test of deception .
The people that con can freeze the part higher the body the try of remember their history , can emphasized their feet towards the door , towards a exit , change their position of way significantly or a &quot; &quot; -- that haven of and change of position a time that all the questions difficult have over .
To often the do see that interview has over only for to that .
Also happening attention the vocabulary the taxed .
Ayr the to the fund and the time last while tenders that their wife murdered was , a for of she to level national .
The people that con also can use a language : &quot; not had relations sexual with that woman ... the &quot; or repeat a question difficult accomplished .
The indicators more common are .
Someone can use a lot of &quot; language been &quot; when says to a question difficult : &quot; good ... to say truth ... to what that i ... to my understand . &quot;
This ago that answer be a in place of a fact and is to often a signal of vigilant .
Not there no formula for detect lies , but develop skills for be the deception is possible .
These skills will the for of who for avoid be the artists of the mischief in their lives professionals and personal .

Always has been a honour be part of that group of large gangs .
We very friends of the people of , and in .
Is surprising when a movement from of a group of friends and is something little common .

How reminds their another project ?
I that very good songs and the principle was something under .
Were a bandwidth almost three years and never tracing a to that after of that ( symeou ) .
There many because therefore and what more important is that still we very friends of ( ) and greg ( ) , that they in the bandwidth with us and when hear a song or see a photograph think in the incredible person that was and how i was cry , always was a pleasure go to work , , about of music and and a more .
Was a be human surprising and what .
The bandwidth national the will the committed of open the shows in at rich .
Is true that you know their work , in special , and that for the opening ?

Are many that could about whole the later on the i crazy .
How has achieved keep relevant the to despite of not be already a fashionable ?
I that all us always we we a little of the word .
When think in she , i reminds the gangs that given before , as , , and all the arose the same time , and , if there summer now , i that is something marvellous because is music that is the it listen and gangs as are doing now better music that never .
The principle , their music had a content more dark and now has again more positive .
To what must this change ?
Is interesting because i that there a couple of songs in the new georgian that such time unimaginable more , but also there songs , as the or that as as songs very shameful although can sound a little positive .
With both , when i the , when the i and are songs deeply shameful .
I that when and there some in your life and lose to a family or a friend , these things start to movement your art and your music and these two songs , doubt , represent that for me .
Also , i that can be a person happy and still so power to music that be whites .

The , that had plagued 11 of the 13 strip the building -el rest are habitados- , were whole the plant we and part of the water , also of paint the walls and to waste of all kind , on all of excess excess .
The three first strip were the stage of the testing , that to two days and to the .
The on the building there a , 51 , that also has seen printed .
Their role , he to europe reporter that since that building was occupied the business has down a 80 % .
The role of the as that invaders of the you the competition unfair , already that to three eur , while in the 10 .
Also , the role the local of leisure had had that to to complaints noise , while , according pointed , the bother not the their the customers of the , but the inhabitants of the home and , on all , the assistants to the testing that there , that had increased their often and modern in the last weeks , according the neighbours of the area .
The responsible of the he that bother were so large that even came to a agreement with the you the and ago nine months that &quot; you &quot; the for .
The in urban also this for the last weeks had received more complaints of neighbours the situation .
The president the group municipal the in the city , alberto of villegas , had karadzic the week last &quot; of way immediate the for end with the problems of them and that is to the neighbours , so as the exacerbate of the area &quot; .
The leader popular he that before the summer only had a floor the building occupied , but to what long of the last months the had gone their in all the plants the building and in almost all the strip , and that in one even have been seas .
In this sense added that , &quot; is necessary end with the impunity and be consist against the has led in the &quot; .
Also yesterday , the building in .
To the 15.30 hours the police alongside to the 35 of the street of mont-ral , after receive the call of a neighbour that had seen that four people the building .
The four were as in the time .
Park or mountain ?
The architects line in the opportunity of the call more beyond of controversial on
The municipal on the 16 doors the debate on the role of in
Of the 80 , in plenary of of the already icann city of barcelona ( ) , this administration a of promotion of .
The mountain as the great park of the barcelona city .
Is more , of a compared , in figures , with the central .
With the death of the , in 1987 , the park the to , in the imaginary of many , as the limit higher of barcelona , being the capital of the few that not in the which norte-sur but down ( mountain ) -abajo ( sea ) .
The rating of as park natural sports in this idea .
The reference already not was central but , with the in the role the .
In these was to that , in september , the city a states 16 notice for other many doors of access to .
A door planned to the idea of park , doubt .
Or that or someone to to doors the field .
The question its single : , park or mountain ?
The , therefore their it merely as what that is of reflection on the city is the issue of conversation between all the architects .
Is almost already a issue recurrent the to hand when two member of this former hidden of elected recognise in a lift .
And this fact ordinary , exactly , to a of the few between what that opinion three architects , and teachers it , that have tabled .
Is , daniel and : the is right .
For , after addressed the with shallow &quot; ago necessary &quot; discuss on &quot; the with of mountain &quot; , whole time that speech of , the of the peaches greens , not has taken to out .
&quot; is from of the basis of that park more marine of barcelona is the .
Between other things their great .
Is more complex &quot; , ruling the architect for who the title of &quot; doors of &quot; within a &quot; trap &quot; : not there that think in them &quot; as the to a park , but the of a areas where there that act &quot; .
, as and with experience in the world , described the proposal of &quot; challenge intellectual &quot; with &quot; some dangers &quot; .
Dangers derivatives of what &quot; uncertain that is today day project the space public &quot; after the experience in the 80 and that had in the area the &quot; their enemy the &quot; .
The first fear is the own of a borders on where can build .
&quot; limit something is them already the next step &quot; , is say , their .
&quot; there that think in new instruments , of planning , because the current &#91; in reference the plan general ( ) &#93; can to ordinary to disasters &quot; .
More to the question , view that , , the it of &quot; can should as a park , the of barcelona , not &quot; , a question merely .
Reminds that already there a work fact the of that &quot; not must we in together it &quot; , although thanks the opportunity that city offers to their of intervene in this project &quot; since the first time &quot; .
And still more , understand that of the mountain with the city is the convince that allows to the architects into in the debate , but &quot; doubt &quot; on if is this profile technical the must lead the equipment ( &quot; all a likewise &quot; , as ) that have had that create : &quot; the architects should be only a tool &quot; .
Nothing that answer to the question that title to this one is complex , because in the foundation the lack a vision global of : &quot; have swiss 16 notice direct -dice- in the sense montaña-mar , but not there a reading , that see and understands the area in their whole &quot; .
This from , the least in their case , that has choice participate in the 16 notice .
Of another way , a project for a of the doors can in programme and definition with the architect of the door of the on .
In their opinion , the city should ensure that strip immediately higher to the round of should at , in whole their spread , a area of a anymore transition between the city and what green .

The secretary publishing details the accident air where lost the life the secretary of , which , and seven people
The of communications and transport ( ) informed that results onto on the accident where lost the life the secretary of , which , and seven people more , show that grant of way direct on the ground in full integrity structural , that pilot could try a landing implications .
For a conference of press , publishing , secretary of communications and transport , mentioned that before of controllers the pilot discovered that conditions of climate were the right for class .
&quot; the elements that seem indicate that unit had several contacts with the ground , the had contact with trees to 25 metres where the unit lost the &quot; .
Also informed that unit was sewn for 19 people , what that had with the necessary for carry the personal .
Also , said that in the research made in the area the impact not the emergence of parts in the ground .
&quot; in a for our that not there parts or components of the in another place , the impact presented of way structural .
&quot; the design the grant was for 19 passengers , had with suitable for to the passengers .
The ground is a outstanding of seven degrees to the 30 degrees of gradient .
The time , the secretary was that is a priority have with the results before possible ; however , the research can last several months , even could achieve a year .
Their part , valverde albert , director general of airports and services diagnoses , was that time the impact , the grant the state greater presidential in at of cruise and that happened in a ground ascending .
&quot; this information strengthens the of a operation normal of cruise the time the impact &quot; , expressed .
In the conference of press , the photo of the , publishing , six element relevant in the research
Flight about
With to the aeronautics the flight was under the rules of flight about , this means that must have visibility for the flight and the ground .
Conditions likely
The in the conditions right the sleep , with is the towards the area bordering between the and the state of mexico were collected of to low all .
Routes
Is likely that conditions of the has a area of will raising and greater visibility towards the valley of .
Location the impact .
The of impact and the last registration of the radar line , probably before the impact not there loss of control not at in the very of flight .
Of remains of the in a area reduced
The information available to the time it mean that impact happened in a very straight and of on .
The of of remains of the it mean that grant in the ground in conditions of integrity structural .
Not has been obvious of ceasefire or explosion
In the website the are are in the remains of the of some kind of explosion or ceasefire .
The last results of the research show that could have had multiple contacts with the ground .
For the jobs of field have found parts of the to a raising of 9 billion 200 feet on the level a sea , the ground is a outstanding that is since the seven degrees to 30 degrees of gradient .
The photographs show the sequence in the expected to what long of said way .
The information provided elements that seem indicate that grant could have had multiple in the ground .
After of the for cleared in a area more wider that website , around the accident , not have found parts pieces of the , what that strengthens the presumption of that impact presented in conditions of integrity structural .
Is protocol for finding gene of
At the sure social a research for be the gene of the obesity in children and young ; is supported in specialists the
The institute mexican the sure social ( ) announced that at a research for be the gene of the obesity in children and young , of protocol &apos; genetic of the obesity of the childhood and the adolescence &apos; , that will have with with the obesity .
In a release , the head of the unit of research medical in the hospital of the centre doctor national century century , is cross valverde , he that taken a team of doctors , nurses , and workers social .
Said team is supported specialists and a of the institute national of health public ( ) and the centre of research and of studies advanced ( ) the institute national ( ) .
In the research attend to participate to the population be or not , come to the units sporting participants the in the valley of mexico , where have to out the evidence to the age , all the i to from of the 8 : 00 hours .
Skills that protocol started in the unit integrating ( state of mexico ) and that since the 8 of october , the activity has to out in the unit integrating ( state of mexico east ) .
A time that ! the aim of together to 500 or 600 age , the study unions in the unit integrating independence ( southern the district federal ) and finally in the unit integrating ( the north the district federal ) .
He that purpose of this research is know the components and the importance of the genetic with regard the development of the obesity and identify in children and young mexican factors of risk for prevent the emergence of diseases chronic .
The we this 14 of november the day world of the disease , that aim is together to three billion children and young between six and 14 years of age , with the consent and supervision of their parents , for the implementation of specific on food .
Also them on the activity physical and background of diseases , with the purpose of avoid factors of risk that as disease or inadequacy .
That i them applies to all the participants measurements ( weight , stature , circumference of ) , the of pressure gauges , determination of the levels of , , and insulin and genetic ( search identify genes that to the obesity child ) .
Cross valverde pointed that research attack to the concern of the professionals of the health the alarming increase of weight in the age .
&apos; the surveys of health of 1999 and 2006 signal that in so only six years there a increase , in the case of the children , of 77 cent in obesity , and of the girls of 47 cent ; in terms of obesity also observed a rise dramatic &apos; , skills the specialist the .
Pressed that justification for the for of the in that population the country from of other their history genetic .
Informed that in average , the mexican has 65 cent of inheritance indian american , 30 cent european and five cent africa and this condition is in the genes that take to disease and too of weight .
He that of way general , the genetic of the obesity translates in the inability of baby the too of energy that ( lowcalorie ) and that transported in way of blubber .
The scientists he that benefit direct for the participants is the assessment contained of the children , what that allows detect if have some degree of obesity or obesity .
Even , said , the presence of of colour ( ) in bottleneck and , that show the likelihood of that and to .
The information attacked of way confidential , the doctors the writing to the parents , to who them it every a of the measurements and the changes in the lifestyle of life that must to for prevent diseases .
Cross valverde he that there three components main that cause obesity , obesity and other : that is the lack of activity physical daily , remain the greater part the day at with the television and use media of transport in place of moving travel planes .
Also must to the high , is say , the greater consumption of excess , of ( , bread , , clones , etc ) with high content in unprocessed and protein and the genetic that analysing in this protocol .
Bury of the
Raphael , scientists of the bioaccumulative of chemistry of the , develops which with for produce a with better every , regardless of the conditions environmental and of
If the signals that are the like demands , not would necessary close of 200 billion bumpy every season of dry in the area city the valley of mexico , warned raphael , scientists of the bioaccumulative of chemistry ( ) of the , who was that if the process of construction and peacekeeping of a is the appropriate , the bumpy could radioactivity in amount or , even , be completely .
In their conference a opinion technological of the bumpy , in the framework the year international of the chemistry , was to know that laboratory to their office develops which with for produce a with characteristics like to the bury , but with a greater resistance mechanics , therefore to high as to in temperatures .
That kind of which could used in places where the climate is extremely a , as some cities the north the country , for improve their every and , what therefore , the training of bumpy .
He that bury , the part more disproportionately the oil , is a whole of of , a of high weight , on , and other of under weight , on , that emis you are the their characteristic behaviour .
The behaviour the bury is in that to high temperatures , close of the 180 degrees , means as a tanks , to 120 degrees degree their is very high and to 50 degrees degree is a state almost hardest , while that to temperatures very in , the bury again , added .
What previous means that in the streets the resistance the bury not is uniform , but that is constitutes for the day of agreement with the conditions environmental and of temperature , warned the specialist in engineering chemistry .
The scientists of the observed that streets of the city of mexico in their majority are covered flexible , the which consists of six collected of materials , of the which the last three the bury .
Between the collected more is the , small stones in bury and then .
Every a of the is the , pointed , is with bury .
The vehicles and efforts , this allows that forces are very well in the .
If like of bury amended still better , opinion the draughtsman chemical .
On the , , put a last layer call of , the which is nation of a material of stone fine , is say , a bit that also in bury .
As is of the layer that is to be in contact with the of the vehicles , must have more force mechanics that and provide in the way .
The be the part the is to receive and salvage the efforts , the of required , also , have the thick appropriate and must they the material the is nation .
The climate , especially the content and the shift of temperature , also are a factor very important to be , in special the water , said , because affects significantly the every of the .
When the ground , the water you in the internal of the and is difficult that it , this level a of all the collected the and , what therefore , the training of bumpy .
In the process of training of a , said , the first in is the film of and only after affects the , but the damage not happens , but that is a process that should to the first signals with suitable programmes of peacekeeping .
The also member the system national of researchers he that burden is another factor important in the training of bumpy and , the thick of every a of the collected the must go always in relationship with the burden and ensure that ! , for avoid that train bumpy responding .
Raphael warned that still there that with and work on the bury , example , that in other countries already are even in the market and it the bumpy with easily and need of use high temperatures .
What you knowingly to the mrs the valley for be the new colombia ?
Analysis of the factors that for that not the crown of colombia .
The valley a title number 14 of who .
Of new the valley the is with the wish of the crown of colombia .
This time had that shaping with be in the of , the crown of silver and the bandwidth that as new who of colombia .
With the result successful in , where the atlantic with the crown and the department already sum 14 titles of who and a to the honour of women that have state close of the crown but that were between them of ( 1947 ) , clear ( 1949 ) , from ( 1979 ) , was valentino ( 1981 ) , mary ( 1983 ) , maría ( 1987 ) , ( 1988 ) , ( 1989 ) , maría ( 1990 ) , ( 1993 ) , ( 2000 ) , ( 2007 ) , ( 2008 ) .
Today the great question that many do is what knowingly ?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great that in every presentation proved that she had all for be the new colombia , not in vain was elected as of the police and better face of , titles that able as or who were the crown of colombia .
The first factor that as key in the decision that took the jury of first who as in that not with their answer to the question &quot; what is that book that you has there to you and what ? nation , of the .
The replied
&quot; shall a , i quite in the literature , i that is a way of , definitely i that book that i espoused of childhood is &quot; the &quot; , is a book quite their .
Currently shall &quot; crime and punishment &quot; , is a book of literature universal that all we read ; and today in day am i the book of , a russian , a book that is &quot; the of the blood &quot; &quot; .
A answer that little pleased first the term &quot; &quot; and second not explain of way particular of what way every one of the books that have there .
But the by the ceremony manifested your relaxed and happy with the result &quot; the universe is is what that has that to .
And for whole the people , favour read a , &quot; the &quot; is a great book &quot;
Between the been says that to valley the .
A journalist that be the corporation , the and the mrs that was all the awarding hypothetical ( challenge of , vote the public the better suit notions , and as mother ) , &quot; that adherents the of the other has , to the as and that not in the stage &quot; .
And that in their first presentation in suit of one in the and their two in the evening of .
Although in both safe , that you missing the force and the impetus that representatives of and atlantic valley .
Lent , journalist the programme &quot; as in home &quot; , the channel opinion that fact of that outside abroad who &quot; apparent that mrs that more awarding earns for the not is as as &quot; .
Also , valley was to what last very with the press , and there .
Other is that valley not in to the jury on their interest towards the work social , that is in last , the essence the national of beauty .
Something , two days before of the election the jury international manifested that them a woman with the needs social of their .
&quot; the beauty single not enough in a colombia , there that look region beyond of what physical and firstly in their sensitivity social , that before of imply the are already in projects &quot; , he .
Also that valley their flaws in the and the you in their , but is opulence therefore precisely the jury the was as the mrs &apos; beauty natural &apos; with the body more healthy , good food and work physical responsible .
The of borg recognised that not had the better body , that had best , &quot; but their problem of in that truth for my not was very , you bowed points in the last day &quot; .
Between therefore the journalist guido , of the magazine as that mistake of the were the speeches that .
&quot; the are well , but valley not the it to .
Their body never was their strong and here the &quot; .
This prize , that first time over the national of the beauty , after the belonging in suit of one about that perform , therefore said that was the you to for not should the will of the crown .
Reality or not , what true is that since today starts a year of , not as sovereign , but as who , position that you offered the possibility of represent to colombia in one of the international designation the own an national .
However , she will to the history as a of the to despite of their step , you was the crown .
So was the work the lighthouse the of
A of happened to the history as the man that death of &quot; &quot; .
The work of these officials is key .
The last 4 of november a of happened to the history as the man that identity the maximum head of the : &quot; &quot; , to through the of their fingerprinting digital .
Of the seven that in that week you the question of &quot; availability &quot; to gonzález , a man of port that has 21 years working in the area of research legal .
The to their career , gonzález worked in municipalities the from , where many sometimes had that more of five days in the jungle for to the website in the were the bodies that be be at .
In the 2000 found to the capital the valley and , then of to the courses appropriate , in , that is the study of the fur of , is say , of the of the hands and of the feet .
The week the operational against to you warned that on clothes minimum for three days .
Something large you than .
The friday in the night went for the in a grant since .
Was that should identify two bodies and that one of them was the man that respected to the more former the world , what that you ’ that on the card of guillermo a ( their real name ) .
However , when came with the team of research the website in the was the not what interinstitutional their aspect physical , therefore was very different the had seen in the media of communication .
Was , clothing as a all of the area , glasses and a more slip .
But the fingerprinting not .
Linked of a , ink , a and the from fingerprints the with the of the card .
Their eye not you : was &quot; &quot; .
That same night , the man of port was the responsibility of the minister of defence , juan emperor , that was the maximum head of the .
In for of the
For a of the of the recognition that was the president juan manuel holy to gonzález , in the wheel of press the operational against &quot; &quot; , is very significant .
Very people not known our work .
The is a science accurate , for of mistake , that can to to be key in the resolution of crimes .
From of the identification of bodies , the support research crimes as and murder and chicago the identity of the people .
When aliens , many criminals have wishful or not have papers .
Us them we the impression and the look in the basis of data .
The scientists counted that , in a case of , you validity a part of wall of a home , therefore in that place the do had supported their hand for from a box strong full of and money .
&quot; the walls are difficult because not are land for from a impression , but in that case we obtain the left of whole the hand and identify the criminal , that had participated in different &quot; , reminded .
The fingerprinting also can seeking or reaffirm suspected in cases of murder .
Ago little found to a man died , with bottles of to their around .
A of the research a family could be suspect the crime and , indeed , a left in the bottleneck .
Although this not does that has been the murderer , what in the scene the crime .
A he that in the items &quot; the fingerprinting with chemical or physical &quot; .
When officer , used a or cut for .
Then of the from are settlement to that is the basis of data , or to the .
&quot; the problem is that still there many columbians xenophobic &quot; , pressed the expert the .
That not all is as shows in the programme of television .
So as not all what that which is gold , not all what that it again left .
However , if can be , if for the dynamic .
The &quot; &quot; defy to authorities in new
Hundreds of demonstrators intimidatory to the place for .
A great part the order of and found to a have .
The those the movement taken wall the tuesday to the authorities of new york the try of into of new , under the under of a order legal , to the place of manhattan of where were of brave and the try of should another park of the great .
Hundreds of demonstrators intimidatory to the place , where wanted access thank to a order legal that allows to the &quot; &quot; again to in the place , while that other part the movement replied the may a park more the north of the city , where has there new arrests .
&quot; our idea is that , if the court not we allows again to in the place , we we to on in some another place and the battle legal again to , so as to through of around and demonstrations peaceful &quot; , said one of the for the movement &quot; taken wall the &quot; , mark .
That answer of the &quot; &quot; the of their camp dictated personally the mayor of new york , michael , came to the courts , where the issued a order that evacuation the place and did to the demonstrators to in .
Also , the &quot; &quot; to the occupation of a new park it in the of the channel the and the , very close of the entry the tunnel , that unite new york and new jersey , and property of the used of .
The least for a time intruder should the place , but after the police out and were to stop to some of the demonstrators , although not could confirm the figure concrete , while was to that was to several journalists that were also .
The organisation will that are several hundreds of people the had installed in that point , where already has a delegation of leaders religious in shows of support to the those the movement and that has treaty of with the police .
Between therefore , the place -que is a of property privada- still closed to the expected of the since of a view legal measures for this same tuesday in the must analyse the legality of the evacuation of this brave .
Some of the demonstrators workers to there and to these hours millions of that order legal and even the to the players that place , what that resulted &quot; some small clashes &quot; , pressed , who deplored that some official by to the demonstrators .
The order legal heated to the authorities to the member of taken wall the or apply &quot; laws that after of that mismanage the occupation or ban to the demonstrators access of new the park with shops or other properties that using before &quot; .
The mayor pressed to the press that , because to that order legal , the city had suspended the space the public and to the demonstrators , to the alerted , however , that laws local not them it them to on with shops of campaign and medication of ball .
The for personally the taken to out of brave of the place , a operation in the were to around of 200 arrests and that decided because the demonstrators were &quot; violations the law &quot; .
He that was the order of the place because this was becoming &quot; in a place in the people not to protest , but to all the laws and , in some cases , to to damage to other people &quot; , already that &quot; some business received threats &quot; and the neighbours &quot; their quality of life &quot; .
&quot; the of this brave was and shows that in the fund is more interested in preserving the interests financial that of the workers americans &quot; , added the spokesman the movement , who was the mayor of &quot; the respect to the freedom of expression &quot; .
The responsible of &quot; taken wall the &quot; also that think organise &quot; large actions &quot; for the thursday in collaboration with organisations community and unions , for commemorate the two months that bladder the protests , that started the 17 of september .

Japan after the
The gdp overall a 1.5 % thank the consumption helping and being end to the spiral of that set in
Since the last month of march the economy macroeconomic was paralysed , still the devastating earthquake that inhumanity in a crisis nuclear , the worst disaster that country since the ii war world .
The first estimates the government of the losses materials in 300.000 million of dollars , a coup that , despite the difficult context world , seems have .
After of three quarters of , the fact the product internal gross between july and september was for to indeed , definitely : the gdp a 1.5 % in compared with the quarter previous and a 6 % in rate .
The reported in the second quarter - for the japanese , the year tax beginning in march of 2012 - is , also , the greater pace of growth since the period of january to march of 2010 .
The recovery it , in part , the of the buying of machinery for restored the areas the and the of tsunami .
Of fact , the companies by their investments in a 1.1 % , with the declining the 0.9 % in expenditure of capital that observed of january to march , the first been after of six months of hikes .
However , the real of the economy macroeconomic not on exclusively in the momentum he that attend to take the crisis for strengthen - or rebuild - the infrastructure , of the shortcomings for grow since zero .
Japan has foul , on all , thank to the development the consumption helping , that in the today represents the 60 % the gdp .
This one a 1 % , the increase the expenditure in vehicles , travel and activities of leisure .

The badge proposes choose the president european suffrage
The first day the congress of the union cristiano-demócrata ( badge ) , the monday 14 of november , in leipzig , has objective large difficulties for withdraw withdraw , chancellor and president the party cristiano-demócrata .
At not had including in the order the day the future of europe , but the issue imposed in autumn , in particular for satisfy to the fighters that they that policy the government is currently too little strict with the greeks and could become in a future with the italian .
The motion on the presidency of the commission european , proposal the direction , adopted virtually unanimity .
Of the 1.001 delegates , so only registered nine votes in against and ten .
The of several minutes that , with their speeches , withdraw withdraw and , after several hours , , the minister of finance , any doubt possible .
The idea key of the chancellor , and of the motion , short in a motto : the answer to the crisis &quot; not is least europe , but more europe &quot; .
Not only because europe is the peace , but also because &quot; nine million of jobs on directly the euro &quot; .
For the chancellor , &quot; has come the time of open way in europe &quot; .
This could motivational in amendments the treaty of lisbon for allow strengthen the control of the union european on the policies budgetary of the countries of the area the euro , although also could in the election the president of the commission european suffrage universal for &quot; should a face to europe &quot; .
In all case , that is a of the proposals of the motion adopted the congress , clearly idea of .
Doubt , is little likely that bringing are quickly to a agreement on this change radical : great britain shows hostile to he and the leaders of the badge seem know that sarkozy also .
But the court is on the ground .
Another on , the delegates have rejected a majority won the proposal of the weight of every country of the directive the bank central european in role the weight of every economy , what which obviously the weight of germany .
The encouraged in the internal of their party , the chancellor has increased the no to konrad and . but not is that has tried who to their congress to at of the &quot; small &quot; countries european or of the countries in difficulties prepared to criticise to the byword germany .
Although the motion on europe he a paragraph to the importance of &quot; the friendship franco-alemana &quot; , withdraw withdraw not has to france .
Unless of last .
Still that , ago two centuries , in a bloody battle in leipzig .
Of fact , was a of the more humiliating for the army of rostopchine .
The impact the fraud in the in
After the benefits , the and the government a for against the in disease .
Sarkozy will the tuesday 15 of november in bordeaux for visiting a box responsible of the benefits family and use a speech on the issue , already recurrent since 2007 , of the fight against the fraud social and the .
Also , for her such for , that part of the will of save of way thorough , but still so reminds to a which of the campaign presidential of right , the majority to firstly in the in disease .
In first place , for apply cuts budgetary : the government for impose to the workers the sector private a fourth day of we before of power catch the low .
In final , unless that there a convention of company specific , a worker that ill lose four days of wage , is say , a minimum the 15 % of their income month .
Is of a measure that could on a wave of ira , but that would save 280 million of eur , according them .
Also , would accompanied of other measure with a reach more symbolic : impose to the officials a day of we remains in case of low labour ( to the time , not have we , with to the three days that apply in the sector private ) .
While these issues , the majority again to to on the table also the issue the fraud , this time looking towards the abuses of the in labour .
&quot; will to significantly the controls and , also , if which to someone planned a fraud , must the &quot; , warned about in the sunday 13 of november .
The as that in the other cases , the effects the announcement seem slightly for the reality the fraud in on of in labour .
Of fact , since 2002 for a monitoring constant of this question and have it various offensive policies that , normally , have given emerged .
The french not more that in the rest of europe .
Handed with attention , in first place , the figures national .
According the institute french of the security social ( ) , in 2006 more of 237 million of eur in particular in labour .
According the institute french of research and documents in economy of the health , the benefits the in , in 2008 , the 5 % the expenditure health , to 11.300 million of eur .
Of this sum , the 46 % is to the in leave and accidents labour , while that 54 % is related with the in disease , figure that out to 6.200 million of eur .
Therefore , the 2.5 % the expenditure in health .
In 2010 , the french have a average of 14.5 days of low labour , with to 17.8 in 2009 , according a study the group soul .
A average that , doubt , behind government : other survey , published in 2007 the syrian of management professional monster.com , that 75 % of the 40.000 workers french rushing that not had not a only day of low disease .
Another study , in this case of that in 2010 the 37 % of the in disease had a than to 8 days , the 22 % of between 8 and 14 days , the 15 % of between 15 days and a month , the 15 % of between one and three months and the 11 % were more extended .
If the compared with our neighbours european , the workers french not are more that in other areas to catch in disease .
A long study done in 2010 two researchers the planning that , between 1994 and 2001 , the rate of lack global the work ( therefore reasons of health as of another kind ) , in france , between the 10 % and the 11 % , with to a 20 % and a 28 % in denmark , a 15 % in uk uk or between a 16 % and a 18 % in the countries netherlands .
The fraud in the in disease not is especially significant in compared with the work not declared .
The fraud has a reach quite limited .
The forward of the legislation , since 2002 , has caused that controls of the in disease of more of 45 days are .
In 2008 , of 1.5 million of inspections , the , in a 13 % of the 285.000 by , that in of short an were &quot; gaps or too we &quot; , is say , 37.050 cases .
In the case of the in of more of 45 days , untreated to inspections , was that 11 % of the cases were &quot; rightly or ; a figure that , taking as starting a total of 1.2 million , out to 132.000 .
Therefore , high a total of 169.000 cases &quot; &quot; between several million of workers a low disease .
Doubt , a figure it in compared , example , with the work in black .
According the member of the , author of a report on this question in june , this practice will a losses of income tax of between 9.000 and 15.000 million of eur the year , is say , more that cost total of the benefits in and , doubt , significantly more that fraud in this last area .

Policy energy
The facts must assert more that
If there a issue that not can try taking in account considerations of short term or simply thinking in the emotion , is the policy energy .
The availability and the cost of the electricity on directly in the power purchasing and in the competitiveness of the companies .
Is appropriate a i electoral be the time of think on such issues and on the place of the energy nuclear .
The debate only will useful if investigated the whole of the consequences economic , social and environmental of the options proposals .
The french must resorted their opinion in facts objectives , in data rational .
Now that we 7.000 million of people in the planet , the development demographic some the duplication of the demand we before of 2050 , to least that to a huge part of the population world of a element vital .
The same time , will that admittedly the shortage every time greater of the resources fossil for to have electricity now , forget the need of reduce the emissions of gases of effect greenhouse for fight against the change climate , a issue that has disappeared the debate ecological .
The accident of not change none of these parameters .
That , germany it single in their decision of up to the energy nuclear .
That not is the case not of belgium , that hearing the their to the need of find a source capable of , not of switzerland , that only has aim build central of last generation .
Another on , great britain , finland , poland , republic czech , countries netherlands , sweden , africa , china , india and brazil , quote some examples , are forward with determination with their projects .
The states united , their on , after you add a unit to their park , the construction of a central after the accident of .
If the model german , based in the energy renewable , is in times as example , the reality is in against of such speech .
The election of berlin is to mean a price of the electricity , a greater on energy the need of gas imported , in particular of russia , a increase of the emissions of co2 the construction of central of gas and of coal .
In a months , the effects harmful .
Must on the case of denmark .
Of europe in the sector , the which this 30 % of their electricity , also is one of the large users of coal and of gas because to the wind ; this reason , their emissions of co2 and the price of their electricity are , respectively , a 65 % and a 50 % more high that average european .
The contrary , thank to the i of our policy energy , our neighbours a bill of electricity a 40 % higher to the of the who french .
While that in a economy rationalisation the cost of the energy is a factor key of the competitiveness and a guarantee the peacekeeping of the usefulness industrial in the territory national , the companies french benefit of the electricity more cheap of europe .
That reason , any reduction significantly of the energy nuclear contribute a strong takes the price of the electricity , what that realism to the statements on the of our country and the defence of our power purchasing .
Is of a price that great majority of the french refuse to pay and , of fact , not opposition principle to that kind of energy , according show the surveys .
Remember that policy energy of our country has lost build a sector industrial with 125.000 jobs of work director and 410.000 jobs .
This looking to the export , encompasses a galaxy of specialist in the markets international and that can create jobs not .
If france leave the energy nuclear , contribute the of great part of these smes and the loss of the 6.000 million of eur year in exports french of equipment and services nuclear .
What a designed for work sixty years , when is to the collapse of their manufacturer ?
For right the equation of the energy nuclear , there that admit that not there a source miracle of production of electricity , the as that not there a source .
The development part of of solutions with in emissions of co2 , nuclear and renewable , shows the nature awareness of the sources of energy .
In the case of the energy nuclear , is essential keep the maximum level of security .
In france , have of a authority of security that has a control narrower and transparent therefore on the central existing as on the construction of .
Our equipment , of recognised professionalism , are also obsessed the security .
In a century , the sector nuclear has suffered three accidents serious .
So only one , the of , in in a conditions operational normal ; not resulted consequences not for the people not for the environment .
In chernobyl , the accident was the design the overheated and to a failures human .
In , some people seem forget that accident was to two disasters natural of a reach unprecedented , that wave the death of tens of thousands of people .
The sector nuclear of this accident , such as what was of the two previous .
Thank to these progress and to a cooperation between the authorities of security , and the operators and builders french and germans , the is a design capable of to such phenomena .
While what all the players finances that want build a central , the interruption of their construction in would a great gift for the competitors of and , since that them cease to free for in the leadership in the inevitable development the sector nuclear .
Is essential and legitimate to the best options for our country , but would irresponsible to that taught , the undistorted and the volume a debate so important for the situation economic , social and financial of our country .
The immigration , a burden or a opportunity for the economy ?
The policy of immigration roundly sarkozy has been that since various points of view : the of the services police , judicial and administrative subject to the policy of figures , the doubts of this policy with the status of &quot; country of the rights human &quot; of france .
More recently , is the harassment administrative of the students foreign the has to the headlines , with the minister of internal ( the newspaper the 23 of may ) of last that france &quot; not needs foreign , workers not &quot; .
However , rarely time analysing since the point of view economic .
The question is that , on this issue , there quite consensus between the left and the right .
In the case of the right , delors chirac the it in 1976 that &quot; 900.000 unemployed not should be a problem for a country that account with close of two million of workers immigrants &quot; , while that in the left , the tone what michel rocard that france &quot; not can done office of whole the misery the world &quot; in 1990 .
The only difference , the degree of
In 2005 , therefore the left as the right the fear to the invasion the territory national a of poles .
To both both , as that immigrants are a burden for the economy and the society french .
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with the act with regard to the immigrants .
In their programme , françois limited to include , those that will right the &quot; problem of the migration &quot; .
This idea of the immigration as a burden , a problem , perhaps is why , but economically its very face .
Such as guarding the economists salute and square in a labour recent that sums the knowledge more recent on the immigration ( : world and it , may of 2011 , university reporter , 352 . ) , there a broader consensus between the specialists on the impact positive of the flows migratory in the growth economic , the wages and the employment in the countries that receive immigrants .
The restrict of the immigration it the growth and it the employment .
The fears related with the impact of the immigrants based in the idea of that these can replace to the workers national , in particular to the little would , pressing for that reduce their wages .
But the experience shows that , in reality , the immigrants are more well commission that substitutes of the workers national and use mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment .
The immigrants little would working in sectors that not by to workers national and the more would in sectors dynamic where the training not is the demand of personal .
A effect positive on the
The same way a dr would difficulties for work in a country that have lack of , the between national and immigrants from that arrival of these last chance welcome in the wages and the employment of the national .
Taking in account what previous , a increase the 1 % of the flows migratory is a takes of the wages real to long term of between a 0.6 and a 0.9 % .
And , have in account the fact of that diversity that immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and the growth economic ( there a great proportion of awarding peace americans and companies as google , , , and yahoo were arrests immigrants ) .
The immigrants also are taxpayers net to the systems social , since that of average a 1 % the budget total in the countries european .
The organisation international the work estimated , example , that in germany a immigrant that it with a age of 30 years operators a contribution ( income least expenditure ) of 150.000 eur to the budgets public of average for whole their life .
The principle of their mandate , sarkozy wanted go to to the points of growth that you &quot; with the european &quot; .
These european , that to the immigrants , had exactly the effect reverse .
Europe invented the democracy , only you lack think in a democracy
The democracy is a well precious , but also fragile .
The continent european should power of this already that , although invented in athens ago more of two billion years , to what long the century which has suffered the tragedies of the war world , , the holocaust , the exalted , but also to very in spain , to salazar in portugal , the in greece .
Some perhaps up that , for that democracy definitely on their enemies , would enough as the vote and the way more direct possible .
We , since rostopchine &quot; the small &quot; , that was of something thought .
The suffrage universal , although is of a condition necessary for the democracy , not is enough only and even can become in a &quot; instrument of oppression &quot; , as said found the .
Not , the democracy required a more : a space public , a spirit public , values , a organisation , a separation and a control of the powers , a education , go , solidarity economic and social , justice .
The crisis that we in europe is a crisis economic , but is to point of become in a crisis policy and democratic .
The referendum greek verdadero-falso had , to this regard , a double effect intend : was the need of a return take of the sphere policy , but also the worrying that of their alternatively , of their inconsistency .
Must on this ambivalence for .
The truth is that lines the with of the battle democratic currently have and that , in many cases , the soldiers republican already not progress in the good sense .
Not gaining if we a succession of referenda national , organised in role of the needs and of way .
A signing in white the european no or a high the we the hole : ! what options for the citizen
Not , not we from by of effect , but a exercise common , of plenary right , relaxed and continuous , of the options and the democracy , this time to at european .
Not there crisis in greece , italy , spain , portugal ( of fact , not where end the list ) , because only there a crisis , the crisis of europe .
The whole of europe is the to the orders of the markets and of the agencies of rating , that unaccompanied their powerlessness and their lack of solidarity .
Is the whole of europe the suffering a humiliation in the sphere international .
We into the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but is whole europe the lose slowly the sovereignty and , with she , every a of their nations .
What more urgent is that sovereignty popular ’ the helm the project european .
Because only together will the european reduce the weight of their debts , authorities of the markets and preparation their future by the investments .
The exit of the crisis putting decisions to at european that not will factored a legitimacy democratic total , unless that be for the disaster .
After have fought for a time against this proposal of the socialists and of delors delors , all the world calls in the today a governance economic european .
That so be .
But think in she a greater integration policy and democratic , and that be as such the citizens , would a new madness and we would to a new point died .
We in a new stage of the construction european .
For build the republic in france , was be &quot; to &quot; republican .
The revolution motivated interests not would enough .
This lesson still being applies .
We build a europe more integrated since the point of view economic .
Only will achieve build a europe more democratic in the level political , a real sovereignty popular european .
For build europe , us european .

The usual to nigeria , the with terrorist is in
Paris concerned the links between the favoured in the islamic and the .
The links between the group terrorist the favoured in the islamic ( ) and the nigerian of , on the since ago time , have confirmed .
The sunday , the of affairs foreign , , even said that already &quot; has the &quot; .
&quot; the way in that both organisations operating and the reports of the services of intelligence shown that are &quot; , he , to more details .

In the rubble of the intervention , the researchers french and custody as several that been to the terrorists .

The study of the on made that towards several partners based in , niger and nigeria .
According radio france ( ) , two numbers especially the interest of the researchers : one leads to that for a time in , a city the north of nigeria , cradle of , and the another to a man that , supposed , is have to and to the .
&quot; is of a progress , but doubt we wait to evidence more formal before of about of cooperation operational between and &quot; .
&quot; but is possible &quot; .
&quot; we since ago years that have of support financial and intellectual foreign and that every time is more active &quot; , says , a scientists .
These last months , these &quot; support &quot; had result every time more clear in the development and the speeches of or in their case operational , that now mean the use of or equipment explosives every time more complex and the same lifestyle that category .
The community international , beginning washington , is since then pressing to for that have in account the problems have .
The authorities grave , of fact , have time at the group as a community of little understandable of interest .
A success
Up in 2002 in in about to a school and the magnet mohammed , ( that means , in , &quot; the education western is a &quot; ) , grooming to the both of a islamic in the north muslim of nigeria .
In this region poor , the partnership is living a success quickly .

The world according the candidates republican to the
In relationship with china , with iran and with the aid to israel , , , and vying in and lack of knowledge .
A america the crisis , can manage a world complex with ideas simple or , even , ?
Listening to the candidates republican for the presidential , the electorate could think that so is .
Since ago a days , , , and the other candidates every time do more statements and in on of policy foreign , traditionally a point strong of the republican .
The , to often , on china , iran , the aid to israel .
, the candidate better it in the career towards the designation the &quot; grand &quot; , has threatened with to to the chinese to the wto and &quot; manipulation of their motto &quot; , a issue key in a america the migration of driven of their sector towards asia .
As if that means the explosion of a war trade , said .
, former ambassador of obama in china and the only candidate that has a vision of the policy foreign , almost to a attitude that &quot; &quot; the emotion .
Has asked a dialogue firm , but approaching , with beijing ( the position current of obama ) .
But , that is plateau in the unidentified of the polls , still being .
The lifestyle of
Also has promised a intervention military in iran if the sanctions not true break their programme nuclear .
&quot; if elected , to iran &quot; , .
&quot; if obama its his , will the bomb &quot; .
Promised also increase the aid military to israel , to obama of have failed with their obligations in relationship with that partner .
The his , the second candidate better mainly , shows their part a lack embarrassing of such subjects .
Recently , to to to the threat military china because beijing &quot; is develop capacity nuclear &quot; , apparently her the fact of that china already at the military since 1964 .
The governor , that supports to israel and to intervene in iran , says that , their part , is now to deploy the army us in mexico for fight against the which of the drugs .

The stream , new door of entry the gas russian in
The pipeline stream , that directly europe western with russia happening the fund the sea baltic , already has since in service .
Must supply gas for satisfy the needs of thirty million of who .
Gazprom , the heralded russian the gas , has wanted so the event with great .
The last tuesday , more of 500 invited , including four heads of state and of government , took to on the baltic , between the music of the and a delicate , in the opening the stream , the new pipeline that directly , under the sea , russia with germany .
Symbolically , the chancellor german withdraw withdraw , the president russian at indication , the first minister french françois and their counterpart of the countries netherlands , mark , have together the of the controls the entry of gas russian in the network of europe western .
With this new pipeline , every year that 27.5 million of metres runs of gas russian additional to europe western to through of a first had of 1.224 km that region of st petersburg with the of mecklemburgo-pomerania .
A second should to end of 2012 that will supply a total of 55.000 million of metres runs of gas , is say , enough for cover all the consumption french .
Also , already about of the possibility of build a third the same way .
For gazprom , the completion to time of this huge labour is buenos of victory .
Poland and the countries baltic had theories strongly the project .
Of fact , the stream is to allow supply gas directly to germany , any the course earth third countries ( poland and ukraine ) .
Of coup , these two countries some something of their power : for them , will more difficult influence in russia with the access to the markets of europe western .
In the point the debate , warsaw not in for the stream as a &quot; new pact germano-soviético &quot; , in reference to the alliance between hitler and stalin for should poland in 1939 .
Is say , if the issue is politically delicate .
Europe western , support the project russian , has successful a greater security of supply .
But the price is a weakening of the europe of the energy , given that project has led a gap between the european the and the east .
Russia has known , in so only five years , to their vision of a alliance direct between russia and the countries western rich , large consumers of gas and with a reserves every time more limited .
&quot; this pipeline is a component of our partnership with russia , a new that we unite of way conventional &quot; , this françois for the opening the pipeline , proving to what point the large contracts the sector the gas are so political as economic .
All this it the broad grins in the sides of the analysts of gazprom , many in , in the point of arrival the gas .
The construction of this pipeline also is a achievement technical .
The is made of steel of cement for against the of the ships .
Supports in the fund the sea , to a average of 200 values of depth .
For , was necessary avoid camps of mines that dating of the second war world .
&quot; was necessary with or destroy a of them , caution &quot; , out , spokesman of the society stream .
Also , s necessary providing the measures of protection of the supervise and the flora .
The is a long word of metal that is as 242 and not is interrupted in whole their length : not , not stations of peacekeeping .
Was measures a platform of control in the waters of sweden , but the responsible the project to the same the see that swedish not were very prepared to allow a society state russian of way permanent in the sea with to their as .
&quot; in case of , the step the gas in least of a minute &quot; , precise .
In case of flight , the gas the pipeline , therefore , to the atmosphere .
But the builders they little likely that would a flight , since that have to that , according the forecasts , will a flight every 100.000 years .
The control the state the pipeline does by a robot , a per , that for inspections foreign , so as by a has that everything the internal the pipeline .
With the way of a pure , introduces in the internal that has a distance of a metre , and at with the gas .
To their arrival , after three hours minutes of journey to a at of three metres second , except data precise on possible the metal .
The pipeline has been designed for work for fifty years need of no kind of .
The movement the gas does simply the pressure .
The principle is of 200 and , to the exit of 100 .
Five companies have uk their forces for power to to out this project .
The company leader is gazprom , that has the 51 % of the financially .
To she , the german e.on and ( 15.5 % every a ) , so as the noticed and the group french ( 9 % every one ) .
These five societies have created a company common , call stream , committed of build and exploiting the pipeline .
Has their headquarters in , switzerland , where the forcing is especially favourable .
After , gazprom to this society , for a term of there years renewable , the whole of the capacities of transport of gas .
&quot; to gazprom you in the capacity total , regardless of the amount of gas that really transport &quot; , precise .
The funding of the construction the pipeline has taken just in a 30 % with the contribution of the and in a 70 % by loans banking .
The cost total of the labour should achieve 7.400 million of eur for the two .
For , example , the investment has reached the 240 million .
But the weaker are insurance of that not their investment , since that gazprom moderating only the risk of the expenditure .
The pipeline the baltic in , in a at of .
A , with 4.5 metres of all , are the door of exit the gas .
There a sensors that pressure , the temperature and the characteristics specific the gas to the arrival , before of that owed to the pipelines germans .
Since the last tuesday , the terminal a million of metres runs of gas russian every time .
To total capacity , will three million time and in 2012 , six million .
