A strategy humble for better hinder the for we have our Obama
Their Republican justify its the to combat the electoral fraud .
The , the as finally a myth and that electoral fraud is less prevalent the United States the number a million people die of the collapse of it .
In fact , even the lawyers Republican have not with 300 number of cases electoral fraud the United States in ten years .
Is certain : these new arrangements will adversely the participation .
That sense , these measures to the system democratic American .
The canada , the was are responsible the of the federal the United States .
In that same line a majority the governments was instance , will we have our 2009 , new laws that cancelled the for or we will vote .
This phenomenon the widespread the elections of November 2010 , we must they the increase in the 675 new representatives Republican at the 26 States .
To , during the year 2011 was done introduced 180 projects the tighter the of right to votes and voting at the 41 States .
Look forward new laws electoral demand are electorate be a document of with which , also be a test citizenship American .
A , those laws reduced the vote which , the enrol as Forrester the Day of the ballot and couple from vote the with criminal record .
Before the elections 2006 , any circumstances state American requirements are electorate a document of with which .
The first in demand .
The Supreme Court of this at the 2008 the being the .
Therefore , the was done quick is now expand this belonging to other States .
In recent years these authorities have supported projects a 34 States for better force in electorate at a document of with which .
Is important to it , the is at the Quebec , people was do not have a document of universal , the card the social security .
In fact , a 11 % the American citizens , it , 21 of million at the age we must vote , do not have any document of which meantime to agency of their state .
The , five million are constituents in 2012 are a document of with these characteristics .
But , is now often , the taking of the document of delays costs more hundred dollars .
With this , look forward new restrictions under this young consumers are , look forward minorities the people with low incomes .
In fact , a 25 % we have our , a 15 % we have our who earn than 35.000 dollars it cost per year , a 18 % have a more 65 years that 20 % is between 18 and 29 years do not have a document of which .
And is more .
In many States even the students , even the electorate the vote is now the democrats , not can be the document of with which meantime for its institution .
A , those same States authorise in Member the clubs for or hunting we must usually vote the Republican to documents which there is a those .
To that before 2004 any circumstances state requirements of citizenship to vote .
Arizona was the state at the present this requirement .
Since 2011 , a dozen States in this has adopted laws that demand are electorate prove that they are American citizens .
These measures for , a definite , to limiting the vote .
It two out of every three electorate put about the total party democrat .
The , even the legislators Republican supported at the 2011 some laws that for we have our electorate the of the polling at the eight States .
Moreover , constrained the right of people and the to a help the people who is enrol .
These restrictions have .
For example , the general election we have our 2004 , the election campaigns we have our for is American about the total to some 10 million people .
Measures taken since 2009 Reformation the was that rate for are electorate liked at the 2010 in comparison with in 2006 .
Moreover , even the legislators Republican adopted laws in five States we must shock the of the time vote you in advance .
For example , the elections we have our 2008 at the Florida , a 33 % the who in you in advance was , the not represented the 13 % is of .
And was precisely that .
Is for the 11 % is , is a 24 % the citizens that they vote you in advance .
However , even the whites are , we must for a 76 % of the electorate , does not represent the 46 % the citizens that they vote you in advance .
Of course , even the legislators democrats and his been conflicting desire is now the to we must party the electorate .
That , even the governors democrats been blocked several projects a .
The Ministry tax of intervened for better suspending look forward laws more controversial .
Could , to , to limiting the damage .
For example , just 16 we have our 34 States adopted the we must requirements is of document of with which .
However , is the new rules taken the of right to vote at the 2012 .
Even the critical democrats it the nature partisan is laws the voting , it is clear that to is intended to influence the results of 2012 in the key .
A report the we have our 2011 shows that have adopted such laws for 171 the 270 votes necessary the school electoral to achieve the .
It is too early to that with certainty whether these legislative changes at of what the system electoral will a significant impact the presidential elections 2012 .
Is certain : these new arrangements will adversely the participation .
That , measures to the system democratic American .
Detection of the of prostate : Do you done the test or not apprising ?
In fact , the test we have our PSA than , on , results definite , with trumped results negative or even positive results , the it decides perform speeches medical useless .
Is a reason enough to doubt in men , have now in itself , on whether to or not even the tests detection .
Does done the test or not ?
We have asked Council is now two specialists .
The studies made with what was a great of as the group shows , the is difficult interpret these data and do recommendations strong .
For its part , the study European daring certain the death among all the patients it had done the detection and to .
The study , with a monitoring in 12 years , proved to there to 30 and the 40 % we have our for chronically assessment if we has done the test detection .
Recommend , therefore , the test will the 50 years , or will the 40 years if your father has suffered of prostate .
And from have a of risk higher .
The key is to a good decision once been the cancer .
There cancers aggressive and other that they are .
Is absolutely necessary to the patient understands to risk of their cancer . the must to provide all the possible and not necessarily try even the cancers we have our prostate are cases against of a , at the which case must be given opt to active surveillance the disease .
The many men the them has been a cancer not are treated , the said cancer is not aggressive or by a risk for their lives .
In your place , them we be an active surveillance the disease and , if one onus , we offer them in .
And more frequently precise criteria to who should or not be treaty .
I recommend for the test they .
But is important be their doctor to should be done the test or not .
Has created , in cooperation with the society of the International , a we must to pros the pros of the test we have our PSA .

Action to prevent disease
Unfortunately , there is a recipe miracle prevent the cancer .
In spite the progress is on , the adoption of several habits of healthy are continuing the best way of reducing are have the .
Believe that if the world well and certainly what enough , could be addressed preventable a 30 % the cancers .
&quot; if no smoke , that rate was done rise , at least , about the total 50 % &quot; , this Beaulieu , spokesman of society Canadian the cancer .
In , we must some of the 10 % the cancers are as .
Many other are still being completely explainable .
The society Canadian the cancer , the fight a remains a priority is now the reduction in the decline in smokers .
The tobacco is with 85 % the cases of the of lung .
Is , moreover , a factor the for other types cancer .
Also detrimental us the health of people .
&quot; at , are 1.5 a hundred and million smokers at the Quebec &quot; , declared the spokesman Beaulieu .
A fact hopeful : 10 years on little to of , the risk they can die cancer we must get that right down being halved .
The burden
The and obesity by also of the .
Poorly we in France are of breast , we have our bowel and rectal , we have our nitrates , we have our and womb .
&quot; look forward research shows reality regular of physical the living it the of breast &quot; , in .
Concerning the food
The authority is advised , also , to limiting the consumption of red .
Is quantities , do ladder we in France are to colorectal cancer .
Are we have our must also avoided .
The as meat for their , fodder or herrings May to the of carcinogenic substances .
&quot; can damage look forward cells body and wear a to cancer &quot; , we for .
Look forward are Vitamins
In recent years , several scientists have examined links between are vitamin and the cancer .
However , for the moment their on are not bombing .
The , even the studies on the osteoporosis and these .
On the of them was done discovered be a in we in France are of prostate , on what it observed was , to , an increase .
The effect of the osteoporosis D the cancer once has determine clear .
A , M. Beaulieu sticking to the importance i have just spoken to the concerns the record relatives out of every opinions are with their doctor .
&quot; do the test we have our detection not from cancer . &quot;
The we have our at the detail
The announcement of the likely discovery we have our resounding be a great commotion last summer , and to .
Was done believed that , in fact , that is involve of the mechanism responsible the mass is what the universe , nothing more and nothing less .
And what is more , is whose existence snowfalls the model standard : our best or &quot; least worst &quot; explanation of nature and of the behaviour the , we must not yet has been should economically .
But the physical is not completely clear it about .
We know we there a new and it is the we have our predicted model of standard .
Moreover , new data this week in an important congress and for physical fact Kyoto seem confirmed it is , hopeful but even and blankets more data for better be and insurance .
The ways , we is , is for get seem few . will what is .
There , in this great world , be a law widespread and vital that two things cannot is in the same time .
There are no is infringing that rule and not best too , because will governing harm .
Even if the physical is particles it a world very complex , has become apparent that we in she there is law of such the principle of , we must stipulates two particles not be should occupy the same space at the same time if they &quot; state &quot; ; a &quot; state &quot; we must consists , unity way , a of such .
Even the physical classify look forward particles deserve this thinking .
To part we the good citizens called , we must supporting wisely at we have our .
The other are , be a laundry bunch we have our the respect for nothing , or at least not for this principle , what that can on the same place and at the same time .
The website adjourned the session the laboratories we must , there is a true , is extraordinary , even the was done into two groups : restaurateurs , the are we here , the &quot; particles to &quot; , the forces of nature was done spreading a which the would is .
These , be underline here , are not even the we believe .
In fact , if there read this of , it is thanks an extraordinarily trivial the or the &quot; of light &quot; it as &quot; shoot &quot; the strength electromagnetic .
In fact , to with a greater burden we accelerates or changing of direction , &quot;  &quot; the camp in that we environment ; a as when we be a stone a hole .
In this &quot; mess &quot; stems be a wavelength electromagnetic ( the infrared , the appalling , etc. ) , and this wavelength is a ; it , the &quot; proper to &quot; .
Camp in more stable
The same the we have our , the to is another area , the in , we must needs be &quot;  &quot; for us to this hang .
The , the in great more stable the . for better is to energy extremely do , a as they runs hole Pisa the just a rock would catch scenario there is a surface .
Therefore a in put we have our particles as the CERN ( what a great we have our is a ring 27 km we have our circumference ! ) achieving such levels for .
The analogy the camp in that is a new tool that explains President the relationship between the mass .
In fact , not all the requirements particles or the materials Royal the camp in .
Some , as the Imams , are , but not others : a paper we have our role , for example , we will never for politician the door of a freezing .
And the same way , not all the requirements particles Royal the in : the are a mass , on the ( the , there is a true ) , not the have .
The , what does &quot; can or &quot; all these investigations ? , question Mrs .
The science , this serves to verify the validity of the model standard (  ) , and allows , moreover , are physical the remarks the predictions of the .
For its part , many want desire it who , therefore the retail trade difference could open a door to &quot; new physical &quot; we must certain holes of the model .
This , be to , is even huge shortcomings , as are proposed explanation is patently on is now the seriousness ( what a ! ) or is now the whites , which some of the 80 % the of the universe ( what an another ! ) .
But we have not and such differences in the CERN the .
Impact
Effects research by in our Day is now are difficult predict will be , but we do we not .or about the total that will any .
For better shows : at the years 60 , even the pioneers of smart infrared the laboratories not all the revolution that their jobs .
Look forward applications scientific , but nothing more .
In fact , as already told the physical , we must worked the laboratories , is chance the infrared at the 1960 , and it is booklet the infrared beside ( the was ) at the 1962 , at the infrared was to have a &quot; deep can &quot; .
Imagine ...
And moreover , look forward applications can also come entire the implementing we must surrounds it now research .
For example , the same produced of light at the 1969 the course of their on research angles .
In spite not that was to original , this serves now talking about &quot; eye &quot; for better the supervisory apparatus digital of the world , what happened to thereby the recent Nobel Peace Prize physical at the 2009 .
That it , of course , the activities of the want necessarily turned into our lives , it but you never know ...
Palliative care . the best way they can die ... &#124; he
In your Commission die dignity , Quebec Indian recently the sensitive issue of the end of living .
The discussion must joined early on was done shape for a .
The , in that dominance essential , is a great deal to .
He has tried it close to my .
Ago hardly a few weeks , the Sr. L. living only in its flat the .
The of prostate to was from had has turned a majors just under two years .
&quot; i had has turned five years of , but have now i have so seven &quot; , tracing , in be a happened , in your bed the centre of palliative care Victor-Gadbois we have our , the was previous day .
&quot; but is always a shock , we be prepared to this &quot; , goes .
The he has rife : be a weakness enormous to prevents go only about the total one statutory and even feed for itself .
At to a lunch , accepts resigned mood to help feed .
Purposeful , establishes an even he , to the unknown to play attention , he bring medicines and provide one .
The courage the death ordinary .
&quot; my greater desire to is I the parasitic , is humiliating &quot; , admits .
A few hours later , the team found no to wrong .
&quot; the course of our lives spend we must an ago up &quot; , tracing pierre , Guillermo Fariñas the Victor-Gadbois .
Back to Children , for certain people , that is a humiliation unacceptable .
&quot; that depends on the capacity the person to accept that regression &quot; , complaints .
Because , the of to in palliative care , and at have in the heart same that regression .
The in patient we must into the palliative care Victor-Gadbois from cancer .
Have a prognosis of the three months .
That state , the team of doctors and nurses you around have provide even the care &quot; curative &quot; .
The of the Sra. A. , we have our 89 years , is die &quot; aware and &quot; .
But the he has done be to children .
&quot; i have a few good children &quot; , adds .
&quot; have i left more wishes in this living &quot; , says , before to it he long be a for better overcoming breathe again ! .
And for , the coming days , would make one final visit of their child who in Italy .
At the Victor-Gadbois was done offer , in the voluntary , to of the body and aid the food .
Are palliative care we must they are when not be done nothing more .
Be able to help that his death be more .
At the Quebec we a bed of palliative for each 11.700 inhabitants .
That is very little , it everyone will die one day .
Here , of goes the best possible conditions , explains the Dra.  , one of the male the .
The of comfort physical , emotional or spiritual .
About the total the provide in my mouth with brandy or , the demand .
In diabetics have they controls its was that rate sugar .
The death of what everyday .
Yesterday evening of he uses be a beer about the total Sr. X , we must died the course a .
This morning , their child was done end the beer in feet of the Patriarch .
&quot; about so in patient as to they loved &quot; , tracing aged , there the care .
The Victor-Gadbois the discussions that never equal .
The of man 94 the its final meeting family the playground , well was between their on everyone they to health , a young we have our 36 years dies are tragic , surrounded for your parents , its on its own two children , After the back tried everything order to survive .
&quot; have been blocked for six months , you there are always we have our to caged top by people under 45 years that cancer &quot; , was done anxious the Dra.  .
A 53 % in that they are admitted the Victor-Gadboisarrivent from his home that 47 % of the hospital .
Problem of the to palliative care
A 77 % the Canadians is simply to palliative care , it , in care some for better alleviate the suffering to and is the of , it in your home , to hospital or in centre of .
And several bodies , the centre Victor-Gadbois the society of palliative is now home of the Grand , was done almost exclusively the be careful in with cancer .
Is precisely that great we on the health care of Quebec what we must ago that there are many doctors specialising palliative care fisherwoman the law have euthanasia and the suicide for .
The in October , an evident signed by the palliative care , the Dr. prejudice and the Dr. Albert , everything to its opposition to the perhaps on .
The Dra.  , the health system of Quebec is not sufficiently responsible to ensure the have about the right palliative care passed its quality before the i to the euthanasia .
&quot; recently &quot; , tracing , &quot; I seen a patient to happen 14 days at the topical currently large other a that to relieve .
Fear that there might be all the patients who die just because do not receive care stating &quot; .
And parallel , many was done with their patients to last day , in spite the worst prospects .
Look forward hopes for a survival Hélène Richard were have now under minimum when he in chemotherapy exhausting .
&quot; when i asked him to my we must wanted stop the treatment , she i told to its many it like to fight &quot; , tracing .
&quot; however , what a she i had said that you had not nothing more to ! &quot;
There are no care
The Dra. it is believed a 90 % the people considerably die grateful to carers are them have with at the demands once they has relieved its pain thanks a team of palliative care .
Is to palliative care not are absolutely the treatment of the pain .
According , there the palliative care is now home Grand , all the patients not they treatments the pain in 8 % the cases .
The living , even the doctors usually to resort sedating palliative , we must serves to ball kill the patient the of their haemorrhaging , the is occasionally sporadically or the .
We pretend that we that part of suffering .
More and , the not reassured is to that is why that sedating palliative .
The they are not say what everyone same : &quot; i die &quot; .
But that it necessarily &quot; I wish the euthanasia &quot; , but &quot; i &quot; .
The realisation of exploit been possible a matter of grants journalism the institutes to within the health out of Canada .
Rented the as at the Quebec
Officials the road network , employers of the , despised we political parties and specialists the from Italian have , Day After the , what we must knows of frontier &quot; system &quot; , the form of industry the , officials , political , unionists and landing .
Be a &quot; industry &quot; we must went too expensive taxpayers and natives , the 1990 and 2000 .
&quot; is remarkable the system was done once we have manager in large means &quot; , Delors , Member Quebec and former the police Montreal .
He the outbreak of the scandal in 2011 , it possible a matter of research the embezzlement compounded procurement the at the Quebec , the Prime Minister Liberal that time , Jean , had not presumed more the likeness .
The &quot; report &quot; set direct link between the industry , the funding illegal the corruption between officials .
&quot; the of the research in 2010 , just the from the Ministry transport was done saved thousand millions of dollars at the procurement &quot; , analysing some of prompts you of proportional .
The &quot; the in let is now two mayors &quot; , adds , on for to &quot; show look forward ploys existing the individuals &quot; .
Be a unity permanent corruption , created in 2011
The permanent corruption , created in 2011 , implemented also with his team of controllers , researchers and analysts the .
This unity operating moreover the police &quot; the maps &quot; , we must , since 2009 , have the &quot; cartel of the undue &quot; we have our Montreal was done to teach procurement .
These last weeks , the has everything about the total registration at the series the accusations there is a fraud and corruption against charges municipal as Frank Richard , mayor a town is stopped .
The list would Savary , we must has to resign office of mayor Laval , third town of Quebec .
Was done there is a suspicion the bombing bribery is now in public contracts .
The formally charged is now engineers the road network Montreal and employers from Italian , as Tony and Wales .
This last has caused shock about the total to have to explain the mechanics of the &quot; system &quot; to up to contracts public .
He same paid for three years a 3 % the value the procurement and in Montreal a broker concerned the from we must the dimension , the party of the mayor .
M. money the and are the years 2000 , granting be 88.000 dollars Canadians ( a few 68.000 euros ) is now parties provincial , the Liberals in power .
Befriended , also , be changed organised collection we illegal the ex-viceprimera Minister Liberal , aged .
The inflation of the cost of contracts including those undue
In Montreal , the &quot; system &quot; of did with effectiveness .
Savary , a public , what he perfectly to Commission : in ten years received those gifts , inviting is now travel , just about golf , restaurants , parties we have our Hockey and bribery for the for a total 736.000 dollars , it in up to contracts undue whose costs much .
Other officials the road network have admitted that received money there is a teach we pay the bills between a 30 % that 40 % at the of trumped extra .
Moreover , a whoever the mayor , Martin , accused is now M. to a blind deliberately the parallel and country their coffers amount of money dirty .
The these revelations , M. resigned at the beginning of November and he Montreal due to a huge crisis .
Was of the political ourselves Montreal we must did sound the alarm .
As unable of the district we have our Rivière-des-Prairies , opposed since 2010 the selling off of is municipal distinct there is a 5 millions of dollars and there is a 1.6 million in promoters at the up boom estate .
The 70 % the is electioneering was dirty money
The research we must the will after , she is remuneration &quot; of balance to understand the functioning the , there is a , for better stop the and fishing in ourselves &quot; .
And adds the process is &quot; painful , but positive &quot; .
We their look forward a cut but do is unity to clean in Montreal and very vigilant for us to practices dubious we recurrence .
How to that .
Regularly .
Delors , for its part , states that &quot; the have stolen hundreds of dollars &quot; , but is the role the &apos; &quot; elected political about the total aware the ploy &quot; .
In 70 % of dirty money it on the funding of electioneering at the Quebec , : &quot; i have that is a for it that &quot; .
The proposed to limiting is now 100 dollars look forward donations is now parties , but that will the donation , according him , &quot; on we speaking strictly expenses are electoral , will dirty money in &quot; .
Answers be a review full the fair up to contracts public and the funding parties : &quot; we not . go about the total we to speed matters , with courage , will enable us rebuild the home to foundation most solid , with more controls and laws &quot; .
If this story pleasure the international image of Quebec and Montreal , M. attend to it laughing take about the total mirror .
&quot; what an is not FC Groningen Barcelona ! &quot;
This season has distinct a new entity the .
How outbursts that advance ?
Could be laid down explain to take of individual , but also in this House we campaign for new dimension of the .
Have great players .
We have our day in we are at your side .
Of technical i am also has a long .
And these elements i same on raising of my game .
In party , this is easier .
Is very quickly the football .
But I not i .
Since my at the centre of far my step there is a Saint-Etienne , always I progress is now bounds .
Is the of competition there is a Carlo .
Even the recruitment of summer are used is now also parties of high level .
Know that every invariably is crucial .
This makes it much a player like myself have wish fight and take everything .
A , Carlo gaining a great deal in the my enabled .
Is supported deputy as claude , we must the same position I .
Does is the man needed the team ?
Of course .
Disposition respect is now the technical .
At , nobody is as at the League 1 and is the best Europeans .
Is great experience and won many titles the best clubs .
Has worked with great players .
I it other titles in Paris .
In January had a conversation very comforting with him .
I myself coordinating in a number of injury .
The confidence have my explains also my good performance .
What does thinks of the in the right first part of season ?
At the League 1 , Lyon has taken the leader ’ s .
We in the right ambush .
An elderly objectives is the League Champions : we mainly the end with style .
What is of the club in this competition ?
Try to come what further possible .
Is now from now , can happen to anything .
We however to many and very good teams Europeans .
We want , to , end the of our League cope with about the total Oporto to receiving the straight back end .
The May become a great European club in the short term ?
Has the budget ...
For better become a great European club , Paris is to titles and it a .
At , that is not the case .
At the economic level , the is handed to resources to that is there .
Not earning the glass at the League 1 , as in the season , does would a great failure ?
Of course , would be a great disappointment .
This year we invest all our on us to we have our Champions .
At the season we not .uch farther .
At the May we our a disappointment , it had of privileged conditions to prime .
Had a season strong .
Here with 79 points .
Normally , with 79 points the been Champions ...
But another team , a season quite best .
This year i the good .
Even if and teams the Marseille , the Lyon and Bordeaux fighting the title , i believe we of weapons to .
Does it is believed that expect the ?
Is normal be a us if we in it invested the players have .
What we have accepted completely .
And we must 4-0 at the home is now , we must is still who with much absence is a little frustrating .
We might well ask what more for the people .
Never we earning 4-0 the of week .
What a we not .re the FC Groningen Barcelona !
We try to a project game .
A team was done constructed with time .
At the League we have our Champions we have demonstrated we to answer and presence .
What a look about the total Manchester holder we must , after two IFREMER , has not yet managed into for better we have our end , and them also have invested great deal !
To sums alas , you ! with 15 to advantage is now today .
That would neglect to opponents and the championship France which is .
Lyon and Marseille , are were the season previous , was done have &quot; powered &quot; for this new .
This shows that League 1 is exciting .
Hope the May we can say with deficiencies , in spite of that all the requirements difficulties , we have ended the Leterme .
The appear to fully dependent the successes you .
Best say have be a &quot;  &quot; .
Be you is very it bottom many goals .
You to the star the League 1 .
And has in the teams the in that is a great player , be a star World .
The group we about the total man and player .
It will be for him also respects the men have to some .
What the fact is truly exceptional .
This to others did not to its of game .
Da Silva , the best defenders of the world , allows also we should all move .
How Olivier lived through the European football championship 2012 the team of France ?
Has been a disappointment .
Was very himself there is a participating in the football championship .
Unfortunately , my injury i was accrue time it must be game .
I saw things it and I strengthened .
Today achievement playing good parties at the with .
It than from my baptism the &quot; blues &quot; .
Learn the lesson to happened in Ukraine and to must be given today would be us an exemplary behaviour .
What does vision you the in the &quot; blues &quot; ?
Is established results .
Are well in the classification for World .
The is thorough , near in players and disposition they .
As the case of Laurent disagree .
But not I want to make comparisons .
Disagree flocking in its objective of these for the European football championship .
Hope that it will has is now with Brazil .
The score ( 1-1 ) of the 16 it is October in Spain was for better lay laid the foundations ?
That game we took confidence .
Every one by all .
Before that shock in Spain , had not lived through a it across my career .
With , pay and selling a banks
The opposite in order monetary current , here the central banks , look forward transactions hidden and there prosecution the sides .
Moreover , as is now often happens the technologies , the political vision is talking is conviction the monetary system current , from monopolies banking , brings of financial crises .
In fact ,  , Zuse there is a ( a ) , is and a single currency virtual converted dollars , euros , etc. that Protocol of change sure how , be the exchange we have our file the .
Have been registered some 200.000 transactions thanks to the 15.000 computers the .
And some a few thousand websites accepted even the as donations or a .
The , after having the top of 30 dollars ( 23 euros ) in June we have our 2011 , fell is now 2 dollars five months later , to that before again to haunt the dollars ( contributions was done at the web site bitcoincharts.com ) .
Is impressive if what compared the present changes world at the currency real the financial products .
However , the ( ECB ) was there is a him on a report to coins lot published in October .
In , was done described the as &quot; the currency virtual with more successful &quot; , &quot; we must duplicates the dollar or for the euro &quot; and &quot; similar to coins conventional &quot; .
Was done the other systems with of coins lot the &quot; appropriations &quot; , used in an and of earning playing or can buy ( and even on ) .
The social facebook developed also this type of system .
But in all exchanges be an authority Central controls and truth it the present changes .
The , the nodes of net are and trustees books accounts , verifiers , interim the and buyers and sellers .
How does it work that network ?
Every transaction between two users the in reality directions electronic in of .
A user can choose a different direction for each payment , thus the deeds .
A whole from compounded to transaction was done signing signature the system of have dual key .
The May so verify authenticity the transaction .
Thanks the file , is also possible ensure we must the present changes we have our will the book we public , it you the .
The milestone key is write that new transaction that book .

A constitution with in Egypt
Is a new dual or nothing of the President Mohammed .
On let us remember that Egypt is more divided ever we need the declaration constitutional , to make provisionally powers a , he decided playing the .
By the there is a surprise Wednesday , when announced the assembly would vote its final text the as follows .
Ago just a week , the had has turned two months the House to their jobs .
And ago nearly two years let us remember that Egypt uses a text interim , several times amended , what we must it weakens the stability institutional and the judicial .
This new initiative is only the must be increased fractured the .
For opponents , the ethical in your &quot; grand delusion &quot; and goes &quot; betraying its word &quot; and &quot; trampling the right &quot; .
Of supporters , was done is a measure to more quickly the institutional and political and speed the transition .
The next 15 days should an organized a referendum .
A time span period of time very short so in Muslim Brotherhood obliged to renounce to project explain the , article there is a , in Egyptians .
For better the , is with being it and democratic on are cause rife the country .
Mohammed appear to convinced the Egyptians will their favour , as in an interview about the total respectable American time .
At that resource the voting very rapidly , a ultimatum for better the Egyptian : &quot; or vote my text i maintain even the powers a &quot; , powers to that its the adoption the constitution .
Is that environment strange the 85 of this assembly , Islamist in your great majority , voted the yesterday .
The majority the liberals does not out to vote call .
Is now in November , the declaration constitutional , had closed the front door because considered are could do assert their from .
Were the representatives of human rights , look forward religious minorities and civil society did same .
To was the quorum necessary , yesterday the morning was done But is now 11 people , Member substitutes , is now entire haste .
Some of them are very those is now the Muslim .
As expected , even the articles voted the been there is a unanimously .
In commentators them ago grace , the to the few discrepancies the working hours has been made expressed virtually the sentence , is so several the Committee arrived that clock the assembly was wrong .
The , i understand that yesterday will was still remains voting , of 234 articles .
The article 2 , this all expectations , remains finally same of constitution 1971 , we must stipulated &quot; the principles the Sharia a deplorable blot main source the right &quot; .
The , for those who the up the Islamic is a vindication fundamental , were expecting it could replace &quot; the principles &quot; there is a &quot; rules &quot; , what I allowed be an enforcement stricter .
The from , that article that amended is a guarantee of its good grace and respect the other components the Egyptian society .
Even the we talk about hypocrisy and that is not the interpreted advertising .
According them , the Islam the constitution the other Articles .
Are , at the special , about the total article 220 , which is now the University Al-Azhar an advisory role , especially for everything anyone who that we have our confirmed their consent to Sharia .
The specialist in Egypt Sophie , is disturbing because &quot; the people called upon is not elected and is any democratic legitimacy .
Here detect look forward premises a theocracy &quot; .
Even the fears of the Liberals are moreover by the fact to the rector that University would quite less moderate the .
&quot; of , not an involvement religious concrete .
With this constitution we the of civil .
The of lawyers we must have been working that text are not intolerantly but it , some of them trained the system French &quot; , explains , we must shape for be an i EU transition constitutional Egyptian .
But that there May be certain ambiguity is article 220 , therefore the challenges terms used the vocabulary religious .
&quot; we talking at the specific on that term &#91; for Islamic ,  &#93; .
The question we must be the future would what prospect is it measure are the judges civil competent for better upon of all this &quot; .
More from their nature religious , the voting yesterday been many criticisms since they are in powers prize which about the total of the .
The Muslim that they are few in comparison with the was during the previous regime .
Another point contention : the powers on the .
The desire to the military , the budget of will not under to , but a Council national of .
Once will even the from we have our civilians in military courts , as were associations the defence of human rights .
These also were their concerns relating about the total text , they was questioned .
The for blasphemy is and , have as from now on , even the abuse are prohibited , what we must could have consequences the expression of , the press .
Moreover , any circumstances article emphasises the women , only the other day both from Human Rights Watch .
According she , what only positive has been the on are being tortured the article 36 .
The word not there to the constitution previous .
But Egyptian President should to demonstrate yesterday evening of the television , out demonstrations to this at noon .
Even the of the chief the demonstrated on Saturday .

&quot; the large and powerful &quot; you hover take far Moscow : immigrants savers the language
On Members and defenders of human rights is the consequences that bring the compulsory examination , have already appeared the con in certified &quot; trumped &quot;
Every year , 13 a hundred and million migrant workers they Moscow , St Petersburg and other cities when it comes to Russia .
They people in the countries Central Asian : Uzbekistan , Tajikistan and Turkmenistan .
Its the sole objective is earn money to their families the been at the home .
The 1 set for December will enter into law is absolutely , the which each immigrant labour must an examination order to check their knowledge the language Russian .
Of , this rule applies only for better those have the to the and services , institutions the EU , domestic services and trade in retail trade .
However , as promise the service Federal of immigration , even the examinations will obligatory for all immigrants .
Moreover , will not enough with in the examination the language , if not the in the history Russian and no the legislation .
The knowledge the language was done must confirmed even get revived and permission of .
Are exception people the countries where the Russian is the official language .
Will not subject this law to Reformation obtain their certified we have our education and qualifications before the dissolution the Soviet Union at the 1991 .
Utility , melancholy and to rights
The net of centres examiners will under the institute language Russian , of the friendship the people , of State Moscow , of State St Petersburg and other institutions higher education Russian .
Even the immigrants can standing to tests in , the in Russia are open be 160 are this type .
The citizens initiative concerning the introduction of the of the examination this State Duma and the service Federal of immigration .
The activists the rights , long before to the by into , Reformation many to this question the press : what need will it ?
What does changes bring of away from knowledge the language , so the themselves immigrants ?
The , they were the representatives of immigration , that will allow reduce of people the &quot; slavery labour &quot; .
Many people lot about today on the defence the rights of immigrants labour , explains Emmanuele , the representatives of Federal of immigration when it comes to Russia in Tajikistan .
The defence of their rights must shot before of their starting .
Only a selection organised it resolve the problem of migrant workers in 90 % the cases .
The problems have immigrants a profession , education , the do not know the language or spend the doctor .
The understanding of language , claims , the future immigrant be condemned to unscrupulous people who will , the guise of help , he Please a &quot; paid &quot; due to a caging and close , where he and dozens of as it that for months a food or documents , working we have our 12 is now 14 at the .
We received an explanations of complaints more of our immigrants .
&quot; at the their homeland them promise something , but about the total to reach are unaware , they deprives of passports , for even the wages Finns &quot; , confirms the direction of immigration labour of Tajikistan , Sharipov .
What a we , !
However , meanwhile many citizens is republics Central Asian want work in Russia recognise that it not only do not know the language of the country to seek to go , but in its language own write with difficulty .
Of course , this is not so your fault but its own misfortune to : are few even the Uyghurs ,  , be the to receive primary education normal .
This is because not allow their families even is nothing to feed in children , there is a not spoken to it , and what to the school .
To the adolescence , these boys was done safeguarded is now to the chance .
It is difficult , if we knows ’ s language , recognise them .
&quot; one feels Ayr and than &quot; .
However , it comes to the law on migration ’ s language , even the activists the rights guarding an important point .
Even the examinations was done will the only for better those immigrants which status it legal .
If not have that status , will or examination and , to , any circumstances work official .
Meanwhile , the majority of employees immigrants are still living Russia illegally .
&quot; welcome to the House or banned the is now strangers &quot;
Many visitors that for status official in our country is not so easy .
The cause is the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties the language is .
Moreover , the legalisation cost money : of thousand is now sixteen .
However , be a for false be done quickly the only thousand over .
For the employees the Russian police know that generally our documents trumped , we are not registered and officer are of .
&quot; we they hundred or at for better cigarettes teaspoons &quot; , a in journalists the citizen we have our Tajikistan ,  .
&quot; we , not do , buying be a paint &quot;
The first day of the into force the EU language , it with are only documents must become to immigrants be trumped .
Several certified &quot; trumped &quot; we have our knowledge the language have been fake by officials of Federal of immigration .
Documents must become counterfeit had been printed at the standard a little colour .
Of course , arrived are the new owners not as gift : each immigrant , facilitate the task we have our to happen look forward evidence , paid the document seven thousand .
This is two sometimes and a half most expensive the procedure to examination , we must cost worker immigrant in .
The main task for a near future is the system of corruption to &quot; qualifications &quot; not can buy , the of the government and defenders of rights .
The , the can promised in migrant workers who May not have been to success the examination the time to course basic the language .
Moreover , in immigrants are speak Russian they grants business that May require no communication active of .

To official statistics of , in comparison with the enero-octubre we have our 2011 , the total number of these offences in Russia reduced in 7 % , what it 22.900 , and the number of reported cases at form of theft extortion of weapons , weapons , explosives and geographical shrank in 7.8 % .
Are currently on strike for the employees we have our restaurants US intellectual fast food and at the supermarket EE.UU.
Far be a quarter of adolescents US are their prime business as cash at the &quot; McDonald &apos; be &quot;
The recent days , the United States is has started a wave of protest low wages it for the supermarkets ICANN manoeuvres in restaurants is popular chains US intellectual fast food , of &quot; McDonald &apos; be &quot; , &quot; Burger King &quot; , &quot;  &quot; , &quot;  &apos; be &quot; and &quot;  &quot; .
Of no if is now here if will arrive or not this wave in nine points , or if is around lose forces and in their early stages .
The we have the support of trade and of NGO and .
Moreover the modest wages contemplate the workers the US intellectual fast food , the goal the organisers of protests is of unions of workers the companies .
Of , this in the has been occupied the movement trade .
Does as the cents it cost per year ?
The started the last week , the day of Action thanks , the &quot; Friday black &quot; . that day , the United the orgy on the cheap we must If of inhabitants , and to sometimes here accompanied of new confrontations .
That day , of certain workers the ICANN manoeuvres , we must employs is now 2.2 of million the world , abandoned their posts and guards we and trade and activists and the shops the ICANN manoeuvres , whose products was done encounter : of revenue modest and correct .
Sells is , since , revolvers we have our hunting and batteries for better car , far , eggs and milk .
Are in their shops are a different average between a 8 % that 27 % cheaper are the supermarket the .
That is many workers wrong measure we have our buy only the work .
The availability and the choice products have done one of the do the America .
According as two critical , May afford the to selling products is now very of , to because pays the piper operation a to workers .
The in complain is poor working conditions , of the in the absence of or naked on .
That &quot; Friday black &quot; even the participants the demonstration ruinous the increase for and complained the cost of the of health provided there is a ICANN manoeuvres happened 30 is now 100 dollars month .
For a worker of , we must a penny 9.5 dollars there is a hour , this expenditure is excessive , they said .
With the scientists of California at the argue that if is the wage the midst far 12 $ there is a hour , to this will cost the ICANN manoeuvres 3.2 billion dollars .
This is approximately a 1.1 % more to on at the wages now .
If put the increase wage the shoulders of are , every visit to shop them will only 46 cents most expensive .
In year them will the ridiculous amount of 12.39 dollars more to on now .
Even the of word satisfied the protest took place just in nine Member States and are was any loss now ICANN manoeuvres .
The &quot; Friday black &quot; was done prolonged in their shops since look forward 8 the will of the Thursday far midnight is as follows and , over to , marketed are 5000 articles there is a secondly .
Of , their boxes sterling held the &quot; Friday black &quot; almost 100 millions of transactions .
The of the , on , declared in an interview about the total website and Post , we must on its this work &quot; less has &quot; employees in the and the protest not had the &quot; another trick for public &quot; , organised the seconded of workers .
&quot; what a cash free ! &quot;
The protests continued this week in the New York , the not was precisely department stores and ( the progressive town for have hold , and the of not are ) , but even the &quot; McDonald &apos; be &quot; and other restaurants cheap .
What a McDonald &apos; be it sells of pieces , and then even you hover Volvo the low of and not for your work honest !
Alto Adige , Member of the Council municipal the York
Now , with the Federal and the New York , a minimum wage is in a 7.25 $ there is a hour .
Even the restaurants US intellectual fast food what are increasing the , but only slightly , and average , workers protect themselves ordinary are the York 8.90 dollars there is a hour .
No earns to them in this town .
How is that possible survive the York we money , for me it .
One time when nearly the fourth of adolescents US experience the McDonald &apos; be and worked there , the desks , to partial and the school , hopeful but still were with their .
Few was the pretended this main source of revenue or missing there a long time .
Now , constantly in certain comments interviews with we had workers McDonald &apos; be it about to live of wage , and sometimes they will even to their children .
The , at the forum the magazine the Street Journal there is one comment which author that it is irresponsible having children if do not know with need give them able to feed .
Even the participants in the protests , we must started to 6 : 30 the morning of the Thursday the McDonald &apos; be the 40th the and , ruinous the cash and broth US intellectual fast food they start to the less 15 $ there is a hour , it them double its minimum wage current .
Also ruinous we must the fast food was done this unions of workers .
The EE.UU. prohibits the restrict this right and punish in activists of the movement trade with tricks redundancies .
A , rarely time the them facilitates of .
But , for objective , is be trade the in are .
One of the main is the excessive rotation of the personally .

Protests had place that same day in restaurants cheap we have our Manhattan .
The culmination the action took of the rally the McDonald &apos; be it some Times Square , the were several political local democrats , in particular the Member of the Council municipal the town Alto Adige , we must said &quot; McDonald &apos; be is sold of pieces , and then even you hover of hospital pays the piper there is a your work honest &quot; .
Even the demonstrators received the support of other leading democrats the York , for example of the candidate for the Mayor of the town garage , said that &quot; we must support the workers the US intellectual fast food for us to forgetting receiving fair salaries the economic prosperity it deserves every &quot; .
As it described paper New York Times , this has been the demonstration of this type the history American the fast food .
But it were only few hundreds of people , not even them all was employees of US intellectual fast food , the of thousands the York .
Is still clear whether this will lit to a movement massive .
&quot; of , is brain is so easy &quot;
To actually increase , so popular among sports to modern technologies , recently is with as usual mainly due to the prism we have our glasses special .
Beginning of the summer , in your conference annual Google proved a at then , in November , it Microsoft had filed an also a request for ombudsman the which observe .
However , a conversation with the group technology interactive 3D in laboratory we have our Microsoft Cambridge ,  , was done we must the scientists that company , look forward glasses have now divorcing due to a stage last .
Of them attracts the such of items lot the pending of bare hands the spaces open .
- the , broadly speaking , what is this will your group to ?
- we the interplay persona-ordenador , but moreover we try of the interaction .
Of the humanity in its great mass been imprisoned the stage of the screen flat , is now the it the finger .
But we look 5-10 years forward and speakers the present changes winds in this interaction .
For example , the video the sensors for a step forward and the any circumstances sold a , it to them interested the there is a gestures .
- what does more we be tackled the future ?
- in spite to has taken interaction about the total standard of physical , of one still happens a screen flat , sometimes we are at the 3D .
The introduction of information has just ( the system a penny more data ) , and way still is not very good .
We to change this , we systems it would be nigh truly , here in different technologies , should of design .
Was done must release the world the is about the total our , about the total physical , do more tangible .
In order to do this , however , it is necessary recognise not only about the total user , but also the space we must it .
Then we complete the real world with items lot an is more comfortable .
The , what an about the total pan with these thinks helmets we have our virtual reality !
- what does thinks of your the control there is a voice ?
Special very it , but do it is believed that what ?
- of course not the can be a panacea , still outstanding we have our resolve the issue of privacy , it not always is to say the through of our action and intentions .
In fact , the of interaction with colleges are good , but every one on his own camp in .
For example , for better of equipment in public , we a project the we the gestures , but it is no movements loose , but shorter .
Moreover , even the gestures was every the House of the recording device , but to is we must risen is the bone the muscle .
Of is very large , but in theory be by restricted to size of clock is .
But , the future is a type combined is , for example of workers gesture R voice .
- how that ?
- for example , how i would your to ask this ha we have our ?
Your shall speak the bring at the same time .
- normally i myself only i .
- oh , this is it have our recognise .
- does a , your want be forcing users to adapt to May or cannot to the machine ?
- not necessarily , but is a rapprochement mutual .
I in the near future we have work to the design are of sensors they determine with accuracy to reactions will be the person .
These be , for example , sensors infrared , it provide a good resolution of , the very important .
- we his work the sensors , what does complaints is your is chambers modern ?
Does they lack resolution , depth or a little more ?
- at , the current generation it that mark the start of our work the credit .
Of course , would good obtain 8 now speed we have our 1000  .
But the issue is not the , but the quality the parent in depth .
Since this last point of view , all the requirements technologies current are not sufficiently to us ; this appreciate the more work in designers we have our .
A , have to not only the but X and , but in Z.
Is also the speed , the number of there is a secondly .
Even the movements Human Rights are quite dynamic the current we have our 30 are truly scarce , the gestures .
 , of our laboratory at the , did a rises we have our contact with prosecution 1 is now 100 and be justified to modern sensors produced at the series are more closely monitor of the secondly courage ( 60-100 ) .
Not the world understand what prospect is it measure this concerns the interplay hombre-máquina .
To me would very useful for my work an equivalent such recording device , but we must not take contact to tables there is a secondly be .
- what is not to of chambers ?
- the now has three &quot; chambers &quot; , one of the which is the rays infrared and the recipient the signal has .
But the House is actually a simple rises of the clear .
This we used for determining the depth of the about .
Potentially , more amount of chambers might resolve the ...
Or the , increased and fundamental the owed required we have our are .
Would good create a prove flexible we have our , playing with the curvature of look forward chambers and see how this help position .
- the I remember , Microsoft , the Google , not have presented your glasses about the total public .
Do you to , this of the use on technologies actually increase , look forward glasses are of platforms more we ?
- of course , to happen the pink quo at the high a telephone very clever at all are , is not very comfortable , but I i is best option would has become a reality increase &quot;  &quot; when , on the basis a platform cloud , you could to glasses about the total telephone intelligent ,
Look forward glasses are equipment very personal , are is to ( to speed matters private only your will see them ) , but also its weakness : has become a reality increase based glasses you yourself not it work on items lot with other people .
- imagine for a moment that it of items lot the pending is available not only for better Tony the film &quot;  &quot; , but also it simple deadly .
There a problem in this idea are critical usually point out : what a not answer !
What an are not are nothing !
Does what answers shape for your group to this challenge ?
- my day we conferences is now often say that increase it is the seventh just in the right interaction to man and to .
I the eighth well could be addition sensations .
Meanwhile , the noticed most interesting is the at the of it the image .
What a with you perfectly !
But there are also technologies that they are truly aimed or the &quot; on the pending &quot; . for example , the interference the rays at to reach a point specific where is the finger a sensation that to that feel if someone as the it , but that sensation that is still very weak .
There also the jailer we must on the it , this also a direction promising .
- does has Treaty of is brain ?
Does to that him feel what we must to should feel the moment of documents of something ?
- that is a good idea , not yet taken it have tried .
Here is another challenge to we fight for a long time , how to a person physically within in space very creates is now open , almost without end . we are working in the idea is we jeopardized ( not as the gyms ) , platforms mobile , the of much flair giants .
Of , is brain is so easy , is to over many years .
This ago unattractive the work with the virtual reality the researchers , we must an are in a state of view .
They personally focuses of culture - Rosbalt.ru
&quot;  &quot; goes the &quot; we have our St Petersburg &quot; , into the in front , is now the forefront of the art and culture .
In this list the best in it figures art the stage St Petersburg , whose achievements on coming further the town : is now in credit in Europe without we must Russia even the meet even .
The new hero we have our &quot;  &quot; is the artist Miller .
Entire the town knows is now Miller , a red from the top down collapsed , to be find closely monitor of the Museum Russian , closely monitor of the garden be the meetings fashionable and .
Even the tables we have our Miller always by is now , where I displayed .
Miller is one these purely St Petersburg , take new .
Miller is a brilliant of we have our St Petersburg by the end the 80 - the early 90 .
Moreover , a man urban , whose appearance and in the streets the town ears of all the inhabitants grins and worsens to the on .
Recently , took their hands an and became the we have our St Petersburg , it has grown to so difficult role , for its existence Bohemia , their philosophy and its image .
-  , why do you in this House we campaign for town a red and not yellow or , for example ?
- the red colour because am leather we have our fashionable and am now about the image .
In this world , the red colour is a compromise among artist , are we have our scenes on the society .
Although it May well the society , and not be a grey from aggressiveness and inevitability we have our property nothing good neighbourly .
But my simplified are in it significant a conversation .
Is the whole story of my action are an invitation about the total debate .
- when will it must be artist ?
- at the exhibition of the culture , is paraded my jobs .
I realised to that was my way .
Then the wave old artists not official had ended , and new , free like myself , was still .
I me artists the new wave , the subsequent the from in Gaza and , in &quot; Pushkinskaya-10 &quot; , it is the new wave .
I the theatre in this House we campaign for clothing and , the music we have our the mixing up , but not the you .
- and all this was done your clinic rights ... - for me was important certainly the ’ s cultural St Petersburg , is be together to search for the best minds creative .
At the 1995 , previously a Pushkinskaya-10 and there , on had not reforms , broad a club artistic musical , a club resort , the house of Bohemia St Petersburg .
Many born there : , about , remind you the of by about the total project to &quot; the eartag we have our are bold &quot; .
And his friends songs small under , trousers meagre , of was the now composer we have our fashionable Angelika .
When the group started i shall touch at the alive , became at the &quot;  &quot; .
Was of many programmes before in Hali-galivskih .
Them we gave is now and the start of their great career ; the basic education and training received of us .
Gallery &quot; D 137 &quot; , the &quot; club , are the of the clinic of the art .
There convicted our employees and customers notoriously .
Am a hero the past , the culture mean something .
In 2000 , the on was in press , the Prize was &quot; the people of our town &quot; .
At the nomination &quot; artist the &quot; i elected i myself , so end my culmination .
In these new times is not comfortable work ; i am a man to like the true , the honesty and culture the past .
We times is easy done it , but the culture the popularity are separate . can be it but far too little seems .
- is your business something recognisable .
- of paints are , are a definite present and commonplace .
I do an exhibition agenda , &quot; the Museum Russian at the buffoons &quot; .
Even the buffoons are a category timeless .
I myself before was her , but now that is painful and other .
But the buffoons to the tragedy is .
I love what grotesque , i have ideas grotesque .
For example , the saved of the world through is movement in totalitarian and with amount of laundry and .
Now and what are continuing in this House we campaign for clothing and , in external , but not the domestic the person .
And , is now that person to should or with the , but at the face .
And deception will the changes amount of laundry and .
- in you hover we saw the role as a urban . - be a town must a hero so .
Who best I for better if !
- good but , does the best the art commercial be broth ?
- now the art commercial be careful , fresh , a village you .
We remains we are witnessing the disintegration is cultures .
Before the people was done at the some , even the wanted is one thing , even the others .
Now all of them have in , it is difficult to please .
Am not a thousand hundred dollars for better like to .
Now there think who you favoured .
Now , every hero and is their 100 fan .
- what a for to listen on coming there is a thousands !
- will it look forward neglected , there operating the sphere sexo-social .
Of an event cultural are 300 people , 10 thousand never come . the , less discharge , less money , to .
I have to fan , what more is not deceive , not to what we must Olivier achieved .
When was young was such tables an even the your at the we have our and .
I with paints , the people stops .
We often who we .
Say culture spiritual , culture kind of consumption .
There is any culture the consumption , that is another story .
I myself am a culture and the example of artists we must in the and died , refused about the total money only for better paint tables .
I am in favour of this culture .
-  , what does it is the Petersburg ?
- good experts on culture .
There is concept : servant the culture .
However we are not all them who can to culture .
Times past when on was right everything was in way , even the on is not seaports very the culture , but know was to in experts courteous .
In Moscow now there very good consultants .
Have got people the it be experts , but are closed , because and experts a higher level we must nevertheless correctly that them and checkpoints way .
Is now the they personally focuses .
Follows the same , but the difference is that they honestly are the art modern is accepted , there some artists they to other museums .
- what does is we St Petersburg ?
- St Petersburg is not a cultural capital . in Moscow there lot more culture , there ground .
But on our stones it is difficult the art grow .
Need ground cultural and we more writers we must readers , this is .
In Europe there a lot of people with curious that it will exhibitions and concerts .
In our case , this class is tiny .
We do the art is we have our fashionable , as it was at of the last century .
The is nabucco with a subsidy we have our St Petersburg .
To light the space
The is .
Global warming or clash with Turkey an asteroid murderer .
Poorly we have our vessels space with Human Rights is now board proceed at the for a planet spare .
To the mankind the main question : how continue the in cannot the same planet spare ?
I believe that operation a where do one or .
In fact , just two are real planets be colonial , at least .
&quot; these are Venus and Mars &quot; , the scientists the institute astronomic State ,  P.K. (  ) , Vladimir .
But if the at the Mars are better the living , the surface of Venus temperature is 500 degrees .
Only be live the cannot we have our Venus ... the space .
Was done started to the duplication the space with the flora .
Ago have now a were the experiments with plants .
Four on peas at the cannot we differed nothing is varieties overland .
Next wine is we have our insects at the cannot , small crack the fruit , look forward .
At the 1979 submitted to space eggs we have our order to check how will legislation be implemented embryo in cannot .
Helps the normal .
But then start the problems .
&quot; the devil is in that find support , should be maintained in the own feet and start ! &quot; , explains Vladimir , the laboratory an institute of problems (  ) the Academy Sciences when it comes to Russia .
The find support , even the by and .
And then from the 10 at the newborn babies was be a in prompts .
Even the not ECU the or about the total Audio .
The misfortune to was the of four days simply was done died .
&quot; and two sometimes we must born even the , but then we will stop because was impossible work there the &quot; , observing Vladimir opinion of failure of the experiment the space .
The time to &quot;  &quot; biological did now cannot was ago 16 years .
At the spring of the 2013 foreseeable even the experiments .
However , the &quot;  &quot; only travel species of same sex .
There an experiment with EFSA , we must were continued to space have now with foetuses .
At , we found nothing .
&quot; this was exactly the , but this was a unique experiment , and studies as this must be &quot; , observing Vladimir .
The mountainous , look forward EFSA space had offspring .
However , is has tackle the duplication directly the space .
Is a challenge difficult .
To , about the total lose their habitat her wonted , simply cannot perform its your sexual .
The man , however , the small animal , at , May .
The is reasoning abstract and is capable in a fund emotional adequate .
Experiments similar not are for ethical .
But the rules women travel to space the 50 years .
The risk what happened .
And most precious thing which they is mankind is the authority female .
Our flying , and no at the could say : if is and a flight to space .
Will or we not .aby and this flight .
&quot; after all about the , to question no has responded &quot; , observing the contractor of the aerospace sector .
In June we have our 1964 , only and a year to space , the first woman ,  , took is now light due to a daughter .
The father the girl ,  , was also .
At the 1988 , the women , Svetlana Zavadskaya , who two sometimes it cannot and even worked the space open , a child .
However , the risk still .
We are few , are wall astronauts who see the to and long flights everything them Hague has outcome well , and a generation healthy next growing .
&quot; and if say it more , is dangerous even at the flights &quot; , sums the pilot , hero the Soviet Union , hero when it comes to Russia ,  .
However , the mankind should be to seek some new every avenue at the biotechnology , in the right radiation protection , at the of how artificial .
The of the centre of preparation that is a stage compulsory in the right preparing flight .
In would , even the profess their skills of the space .
The water the cannot .
If for an adult the water is a comfortable , hopeful but still hostile , for a child newborn born the element home .
Even the small hombres-anfibio seem i can confirm of at the emerged of the Atlantic .
A baby is around 9 months in his mother the tanks , therefore he will easier used then the .
At , this is logical , because the birth to the one statutory spend only 2 weeks .
&quot; this is very little for better forget something &quot; , says Marina , we have our swimming of babies .
In short , to cannot is a natural for a newborn born , for women is necessary the example of how .
In the right cannot even the muscle and was done very quickly , the are expulsion of the experiments down .
Good , by restricting at the if it is encouraging to the whole childbirth .
Be , of course , to light a House special , this .
&quot; and then need ? &quot; , the original question .
A , as also needs seriousness artificial .
The sensation that and , the authority not there skeleton or the system lymphoid .
A newborn born at the cannot it is impossible with cleverer special for better , as in adults .
Simply the time to is vital to give to him .
&quot; and this experiment we must we do together , to the birth of as the strange , will in a disabled , to completely suit &quot; , directed the Committee bioethics an institute of problems the Academy Sciences when it comes to Russia , Angelika .
Of , the birth of children the space that is a theoretical question .
However , the time this will , when even the human in their vessels was done be responsive a planet ago the home for their children babies the space .
Of the head : the inspection the &quot;  &quot; not has the political guilty
On tenders public , the Czech Republic we good inspectors and a legislation passed its quality , even though its implementation .
This claims Ransdorf , of research the office is by (  ) in an interview for better Aktuálně.cz.
&quot; the will never perfect &quot; , but its implementation must be right . &quot; this is , in my view , what we lack &quot; , so describes the current situation .
The controls sets the inspectors Czech and Germans also they similar conclusions .
As example a practice wrong , mentions the as the system to be only on the , we must is the system &quot;  &quot; .
The Prime Minister told recently the ODS ( democratic party civic ) not the entrepreneurs with inspectors . then , is banned or allowed ?
&quot; the must be suppressed it and if prohibits something , that case , or the can prevent take the office have to perform those controls demand duties &quot; , complaints .
The meeting the Commission is the Congress the Members , Ud. talked for the project common between the team Czech and German , the which was done Karadzic law corrective to tenders public in both countries .
Is exactly ?
Is a control parallel are to the two years .
In way simplified accurate is European legislation how the organise look forward tenders public , to he the existing legislation in country and , next , these is .
Us we United everything and , but control even has not complete , we have obtained differences very interesting . generally , the legislation of our country is &quot; stricter and full &quot; , however , these concrete in some parameters is better in Germany .
Was done confirms , therefore , we must not enough to merely integrate rules and stricter , it is necessary hinge on the implementation the same .
Is or in fact this project ? what it is believed that are the conclusions ?
Precisely a common monitoring of this type could to Age to on the closer is laws , the it the , though this does not an impact so positive .
The of the saving mean a something appropriate a reasonable price ( what are always mean the price it the under ) to the enrichment and , the long , the criminals .
But not the fact of reducing limit is tenders that we to that .
Perhaps because the system is saturation with so &quot; red tape &quot; , make sure that those they to seek failings the system can do more easily that if the maintained so high as now .
Ud. about the our country with the switching the legislation which regulates is tenders public .
How does it work must modify the at home in Germany ?
Is an office analogous to or was done t in way ?
At the how to offices , there in ( Court Federal we ) , with a to our , in school also , this in their case is structured of way is different , but at both offices evolve parallel .
Also get the powers the is , however , the Germany is a Federal , the accounts in to that level . in this aspect adults slightly of our system .
The Court Federal we (  ) can only monitor the Federal , what we must here call funds state .
The public , that they are administered there is a municipalities , there , at home in Germany , monitored the Court Federal we .
The local legislation , is simpler than the our ?
We , not the comparison a specific data . not however , Germany remains a in some ways , but not be must to what prospect is it is better .
Would that be best , for example , the quality the inspectors ?
This sure are , but , repeat , i do not like to do this type of comparisons .
It is necessary that even those countries we a must to of problems .
If not it so , for contribute any circumstances benefit with our office , you believed that ?
The legislation of our country , what does meant for his office the amendment a tenders public ? the holding demonstrations it its only ?
In it the time of this amendment is relatively short , not yet has been said the actions is .
Have time controls ex , be to an are .
Of , is the preparation the controls future : we have started a new tool &quot; detection by not economic &quot; , to have we done to happen almost 14.000 tenders public , we must have been considered . the present changes will perfectly reflected here , it the limits , was done the of types the selection and similar .
To the of this law is beneficial or , to , a patchwork to the whole bureaucratic system ?
I this law is surely a step in the right direction right and hope that it .
The be eventually is that regulations &quot; was done strengthened &quot; and it must .
Have now with the regulations previous , are the people controlled were linked on the contractor ( for example , and operational programmes regional of the Regional Council ) , and law not respected on tenders public mean the violation of budgetary discipline .
Does sense then tighten the ?
I do not the .
The system should be ruled out to want or profit it and not punish commit is formal , the only the decisions .
A system of this type only will to establish a greater pressure bureaucratic .
What how was the fellow of this ?
Will to get us brings this road started .
The Prime Minister has recently stated that he the ODS not the entrepreneurs with controls of the out system , with the be only on the . what does this mean ?
The system &quot; outside or allowed ?
The must be suppressed it and , if prohibits something , then even the Prime Minister of the government can prevent take the office have to perform those controls and demand duties .
Can say : &quot; the and allowing &quot; , but cannot say we as if nothing .
The law the tenders public , the regulations is quite stringent on the way in be we formally . and that as be to protect the competition public .
But , is tragic it excluded about the total candidate with the best supply there is a not to comply formal requirements .
The will never perfect , but its implementation must be right . this is , in my view , what we lack .
Poorly upgraded roads inherently Rachinel is , hopeful but they passable
At the several from the Czech Republic poorly upgraded roads inherently Rachinel is and snow .
Even if the majority is every avenue are passable , in certain comments should be likewise the caution .
Of resort
Today the morning poorly upgraded roads in the right of resort was passable , but were Rachinel is and snow .
The temperature falling and abolition between five and ten degrees under zero . over on slightly are .
Has longer in the region in and in up snow is thin .
In , the square statistic the snow high almost 30 centimetres .
In some places the visibility was even bad of fog , the information of the centre is of poorly upgraded roads the region .
To fast R6 the road the category in the region are now passable without restriction .
However , is providing the caution , in some bridges whose surface be and be slope .
Also , are also passable all the requirements every avenue the and third category , such poorly upgraded roads the .
Not however , at the some of them is stretches with of ice and snow .
Be must be increased to road , in and the .
Of and Hradec Králové being
In certain comments roads of Bohemia Eastern there danger frost in areas the mountains May have be a up snow the , reports in their pages the roads and motorways .
Even the workforce the notice in drivers the danger it train Rachinel is , in areas the region .
Can is frost the took we have our , Labem ,  , or , and the roads the third category .
Poorly upgraded roads i / 43 and i / 34 at the have been treated cosmetic .
There snow especially the roads of mountains is now .
A up snow the areas highest is road the municipalities Labem and .
The Bohemia Eastern , the sky will today between spending and partly , a snowfalls .
Look forward temperatures we between three under zero and a degree positive , a wind weak .
Of
Poorly upgraded roads in the right of are passable the morning , hopeful but must likewise the caution and will necessary adapt the same time .
The early hours the morning will frost , look forward temperatures between three and many degrees under zero .

: we concerts we want accrue positive energy
It is claimed in than a month is to reach the world , what does about his position ?
Only of training is between many others news scare to we like ultimately .
About the total the music adjourned the session we like to do jokes on this and that we are only the world that have manages together enough positive energy to the world or prevent .
Moreover , in December a project is truly original : three concerts the end of the world .
The explain to readers ?
Is an act proven State have organise have been blocked for two years .
We to the potential of marketing have the calendar of for worded wisely for better 21 set for December to 11 : 10 the morning .

Standardise around is now the same time we are in stops the calendar of for the island , the Pacific Ocean , 12 at ahead of our area explainable .
To who the was this idea ?
Initially was my idea , next were the all together with our leather .
Also to together enough positive energy and be beaten the world , we think again , with the society , the state of we the to our children .
With occasion in calendar of for also we have created a now only goods : you , parcel , sewer overflows and original the end the world that have can advertised at the www.e-tap.cz , other is safely .
The group adjourned the session , with other performers , also sung the anthem the end of the world , it there is a title &quot; end of the world , cancelled &quot; .

How emerged this collaboration ?
We together to other personalities the stage cultural Czech , from organise many acts Live and concerts ...
Our all our plays at the participating in the project .
Has become apparent to of them interested and work with us .
To what it is will the youngsters the concerts the end of the world ?
Is now equipment for better the education without barriers , have a at the its sixth year running with the civil .
Even the pupils the school are regularly visit teachers the doing activities humorous and interesting .
Even the pupils do not have economic resources enough pay in teachers and a to possible .
The completion is works , will a building independent to we with this project .
In Live Aid act several group and performers .
The criteria we have our selection ?
Tries a programme be unattractive for all look forward generations , including children .
For example , at the Prague ,  , with on , adjourned the session , and Jiří Paroubek .
To information more detailed , Now put www.kpks.cz.
Does you have measures some other &quot; Action spectacular &quot; similar the future ?
At the May we there is a first time the festival , so here surely preparing a programme unattractive with invited interesting .
In it also we like touch the National Hall the York of me , personally , as we United States , the amplify with actions in Washington and Chicago .
Plans the abroad are not precisely , to you action for example in Madrid , Brussels , London or Moscow .
Adjourned the session is , not however , a group in people with disabilities .
How is the logistical the Organisation of travel ?
Not that difficult how May appear in .
There are five Member at the chair we have our wheelchair we , look forward chairs must travel the stationary for better luggage and moreover have burden , look forward boxes the instruments ...
However , to we look forward managed well . and British major were perfectly prepared , something is they are amazing .
Even in Moscow , we have our where we have their in , went above all without problems .
Thanks to through about the total abroad Now for various attitudes the society the disabled and other aspects .
In need you ! you and to ?
In Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other cities , everything works better than it here ; in Russia have witnessing to , still a long way to go to .
The Prague , Moscow is we have our barriers , there of be often we must a person was done properly alone the centre the town at the wheelchair we .
Something so aware a , for example , to anyone wish to speak chair we have our wheelchair lift , there is not .
Fortunately we are , the created an association civil it intensive there is a problems of people with disabilities .
In ways we must to example of countries most progressive ?
There many points the we there is a behind ...
But is important mention the as the improvement the situation always depends on of people to directly affects .
I shall be in London in Madrid is very people to with disabilities serious was done properly there is a of public can go about the total service , about the total Museum , where wants ...
But is not very to of people with disabilities obtain a social are active , in this aspect , with adjourned the session what a we a bit ahead !
A society which or without barriers is , but when time comes the establishment eminent athletes , artists , players , political or lawyers , start change everything the .
To , are cases isolated a million people we must a great strength the .
The group adjourned the session is at present very it , but if at a few years back , what does you ! he be the group at the 1998 ?
I as at the , where to many young people to my some we must wanted interest something .
And because I musician ,  , among others , a group healthier in about work .
And the our mediating , we are seen as was an are ( laughter ) .
However , the popularity not came far the years , or am I wrong ?
Is true that helped us the in we must connect with singers famous and also work actively for better promote Group of the European .
We came conclusion the work is , is to matters .
Thanks to aid the European Union , we afford to moreover teachers passed its quality , equipment , etc.
Does belong to reach so far with adjourned the session ?
At the I saw the potential to which he had , is to do something in any other way .
The entertainment is full is it seem the to others .
Are , to way , is new was done welcomes with caution and long time at the accepted .
There nothing extraordinary , but I dare to adjourned the session is of them .
The different impression somebody the documents of there is a first time is a definite compassion , that is a natural reaction ...
Is compassion is wholly are talking about the Maldives because people with disabilities not are they that suffer the we a village .
There people we must is capable of putting live a good life full and develop , with the status , of course , to have the necessary tools to .
I always say if something them fellow a people with disabilities , then , is not only an advance for them , but a society is in .
Does helped the is Ud. a chief challenging assignment , as he describes many people ?
If we want to do a passed its quality , have got be rigorous at the many ways and demand certain discipline .
I that normal .
Some people come a romantic an and the clouds and the hear to come two days is now fraud , to test preparatory and to happen a long time travelling in concerts , the euphoria who them or quickly .
But how the operating the , in group who May want work and something .
Now the group adjourned the session is twenty Member .
How many them were the days the 1998 ?
Only one : .
We are a group open , the people are and fellow , it cannot be .
Who have will and wish heart always look forward to

Poland and the manage .
The meeting of Ministers the countries the agency European Space held week the EU last accepted is now Poland as twelfth Member the . is the second country Member the of the former which the , after the Czech Republic , it for at the full member the 12 of November 2008 ) .
Poland whereas be an intensive collaboration with the in 1994 and the subsequent years part at the projects the agency .
However , the to Poland to manage started long before .
Even the enthusiastic Poles the son in flights to space before the Second World War , but always been passed about its job .
Remind you , for example , the we have our A. the Centre promptly astronomic we have our Warsaw we are in , the 6 set for December 1933 , presented its ideas the study pioneers &quot; introduction is now drawing &quot; .
Look forward ideas of the young engineering draughtsman ( he was born 1905 ) on in assistants indifferent and , years on little , us the Dr. : Jan was only were interested in his work .
In 1934 successful in both France the Prize Robert Esnault-Pelterie and mr Louis as for its &quot; introduction is now drawing &quot; .
The dr Ayman Nour : Jan ( 1899 - 1966 ) , became later in great drive the exploration and drawing .
Published hundreds goods at the journals Polish and wrote a number of books dedicated to discipline scientific .
Became in mover of drawing , was entered the world and to the science were rewarded the it its name and the for hidden of .
The in 1925 was in Poland be a we must to be in we have our an engine of rockets .
Unfortunately , was done unknown who was of the proposal and nor they of the project .
It is if the had to be used in the or for their while .
The information about this is limited to Land Acquisition in the press the .
Will the 1933 the artillery Polish started interest in rockets .
The research was funded by in cooperation with the . and .  .
Will of the material retained , the it the research came about the total Charleroi stadium is evidence practices .
Not however , with the arrival is troops German , was the research .
In 1937 about in the press specialised the missile hunting designed the engineering draughtsman and in as follows was published study &quot;  - i &quot; , of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki .
Both projects were for about the total use military the engines for better rockets .
Operation a before of war , the Committee advisory scientist interim (  Doradczo-Naukowy ) was done responsible the projects techniques missiles to deliver use military and business .
The Committee was founded at the 1937 , but and two years of , were cut the beginning of war .
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics occurred in the press Polish after the war thanks without the work of society (  ) .
At the of November 1954 the magazine the reference for first time to society with four articles very they dedicated .
At the of them , of the . M.  , was done proposed of a society which claims to be devoted is now drawing .
This era of the had up in projects set of satellites artificial and was obvious the research cosmic was a discipline with brighter the .
Since early this 1956 the society Polish we have our (  ) hoped is now of the International Federation ( up at the 1951 ) in autumn that same year the became full member .
The next year the President the ,  ( 1902 - 1959 ) , the of the International Federation .
Occupy this office until his death in 1959 .
Will of the 1956 , the part in significant the rest of had probe (  ) , it a success and became the had Polish the he carry out scientific research .
The first type RM-1 was complete at the 1957 and launched the 10 it is October 1958 .
The had to a of 1.800 metres , a few 80 cm of country which and hardly in 5 kg this .
Later , was done end to was RM-1A in summer we have our 1959 were look forward evidence airlines the rockets RM-2 we have our two stages the desert .
The had severs 1.4 metres and a few 11.5 kg.
Another type of had the to the scientist real . the had RM-34 to we of 14.5 km and its task would control wind we have our high .
However , at the 1962 were even the business .
The successor the prime rockets of the type the had Meteor-1 , it was the years 1962 and 1965 .
Was done as had two stages , with length in 510 cm and healthy body weight who we have our 32.5 kg.
Was done proceeded three types ( called Meteor-1A , -1B and -1C ) , it differed are the space available the supervisory apparatus scientists .
The had Meteor-1A the space available to the volume was we have our 0.4 litres , the Meteor-1B we have our 0.34 litres it Meteor-1C we have our 0.62 litres .
The of maximum the three types was we have our 37 km.
The years 1965 and 1968 developed the institute air had Meteor-2 , whose early evidence airlines were in October we have our 1970 .
The had Meteor-2 to healthy body weight who we have our 380 kg and was capable of putting a burden useful 10 kg far 60 km we have our high .
Subsequently was Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 .
Is to also the Poland the ( openly at Roslin ) in 1960 and of the national we have our two years later .
The programme , Poland joined the research the opinion of satellite artificial Soviet and , in 1978 , the pilot Polish became the second next of Vladimir Remek .
From the opinion of business social is not the solution .
The last week who constitutional suspended the social .
The adherents be a heated discussion the society .
Certainly will interesting examining Commission existing a bigger view .
The liberal economic the EU , so the globalised world , they are based the basic principle a greater competence economic and less I .
To , this means the various forms economic and the national economic are on permanent are .
The cause is the principle of the free trade and free movement and unlimited for private , with the financial speculation unbridled .
The effect of the labour cost ( the wages ) way tensions economic .
Under this is need the situation in the manufacturer , with the import of freight cheap , try to shorten travel and to &quot; from be a &quot; of the price competitor the objective of these done the part the and , to , to raise its for profits .
The scale mean , the in most employers , enterprises is about the total abroad , buy there cheaper it unconditionally as . the unemployment high at the those countries in the price the , in comparison with other competing economies , is the .
Because the private capital is social responsibility is patently and , to , nor is responsible of the unemployment that phenomenon there , overall necessarily the social spending of .
This whole situation being the total parental the employers there is a pay taxes and compensate the damage economic and social that have caused in your be in profits .
Is universally so familiar are it is necessary present statistics concrete .
Look forward practices operation a private for moment , in certain economies , the governments involved are these countries are forced compete the goal of reducing artificially standard of social the population itself and , to , attract foreign capital the .
In other way , even the governments are correctly private capital available to of their population itself to account the decline social .
This observe in the present changes is laws force .
The aim is to population that i dictated the private , in what the wages .
Is place , to part , through the why economic the case of unemployment in than ; on the other , through the restricted right the employees in the labour rights .
The result is increasing poverty with the differences between poor and rich .
Have been blocked for a number of years , exist at home in Germany to food for better people who not be maintained in with their own work .
Of who are this type of aid establishes a have now about the total million .
The in the competitiveness of the German , is the quite often : employed with a so under the state should be pay the rest to the absolute minimum order to survive .
Was public a corrupt scandal of this type concerns to employees diagnoses the Federal German .
Measures we have our saving virtually every the of the southern EU gets , we , the same situation . are the people , repeated for a decline of their standard of social , are forced must the century or with a rotten the limit of society , with the hope that it will after all one day when the capital investor private .
Is where are the next ?
For it about other countries the EU , then the poverty of country to another or a never , the Chinese , Indian , brazilian , Turks , Moroccan , Egyptians or African are continuing working towards a tiny of a European .
This also concerns entire Latin America .
Corporation Liberals the of communication by to all the state should not or capital is , you the will to failure .
The private capital it with tooth and European the i the state should not intervene in the control .
Next , it is necessary ask if the private capital not affect with his selfishness at the political and , therefore , the state .
In this case the answer is definite .
The test is of lobbies , in practice very powerful and curse , in all the .
The situation some it holding demonstrations the as the corruption , the lobbies mutual , a legislation which is practically reprehensible the but not a .
At home in Germany the situation is even the ministries state , is now in the absence of financial tools to , are the wording of projects an is now companies legal private , look forward which are is now often linked the industry .
This type of projects an are adopted next the Bundestag , the German Parliament .
To , everything of power not emanating from of the people , perhaps and as is the constitutions of the democracies western , but the strong group financial we must for their own interests .
Naturally the democracies with it Liberal was done who quickly a situation how the describes in your work the Roman in times Caesar and : &quot; the was time the administrations was done within the &quot; .
Is now in bribery , lobbies and aid for finance stones or functionaries .
The admissions the corruption spread a from any people will come in on to polls the vote you in advance &quot; ... &quot; had not people with nature we must a in the , so once , of this dear , the here eight months a consuls &quot; ... &quot; started hears are we serious the only no for a so serious the autocracy and it is necessary decisions a determined &quot; ... hopeful but any at the , Caesar by the and transformed the democracy for it autocracy .
The conclusion , the way the , is the society current the preferences discredit of the benefit individual to account to financial interests common .
The private capital is not capable , in your essence , we have our understand and ombudsman of the society .
The same the to , quickly the elite unprecedented , the be a to reforming them of .
Concealing the causes of the on the regimes fascist and Communists should be other , is thus the , at the liberalisation unbridled the economic systems the century and which .
With respect the current situation , that be considered the these systems at the benefit of a democracy of Liberal , as pause defined , for the coup .
The in is truly is the elite current verbal acknowledgement completely the losses of thousands at the lives , catastrophes social and humanitarian is we been witnessing , so the crimes of mankind , the we the history former the most recent .
From the opinion of tenders public is not the solution ; at least not a .
Under pressure the economic competition , so and as within the EU , the Czech Republic be to for other ways to standard of social the .
This trend is , is thus the , systemic .
The solution happened there is a reforms tangible , we must strengthen the participation of the capital of the influence the citizens in the and weaken the monopoly private capital the society benefit .
Israel : the laboratory of the chaos .
&quot; that deforestation and could &quot; ( not arises nothing of violence and could do ) , in your song and which He &quot; Let &apos; be do we not .elieve we can Regions subjects &quot; ( us not forget the fragile we ) .
&quot; if my children is not wars , not would any &quot;  , wife we have our Mayer Rothschild , in your bed the in 1849 .
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and of Gaza , have ‘ , as always , and various .
Be a , of the on Israel , it in favour of the right of and the Palestinians the role of terrorists . the supports the Palestinians and argues racism the state of Israel , genocide perpetrated by against Arab Palestinians and accordingly Israel the terrorist .
Not I wish to focus on who is guilty of a great unprocessed it are regular is the are paying . the , even the people in the people of Israel , including the be predominantly , born in the current political and not lived very early days violence .
My intention is offer to readers be a look the curtain , be a look for better be who out advantage is tensions it prevails have been blocked for 95 years ( calculated will the declaration prejudice in November 1917 ) a small surface of land of the Middle East the midst .
Some of my considerations they are based historical facts , others at the conclusions to I come EU the my own way do the subject , opinion of who or what of is the eCall Driving the events the modern history .
The history the mankind is struggles the power is first class .
In era of we can find a Great or Rostopchine .
But it clearly is were always these resolute the with their leaps and bounds in an or whether behind of their seat had is their actions to a goal .
We must accept that we a time has the wealth of the world the hands of few individuals and to this concentration of money and the be this involves , not been to single generation .
The families richest least be a we must be the more prominent ( if is somebody behind , do know , but do not rule ) : the Rothschild .
Not it says to some them .
Course .
The 90 the nineteenth bought the first to news ( Jazeera ) for us to any with its name with criminal acts much seriousness . of power the wealth , or both , them portions look forward back , something for them always meant a just .
Have cautiously important in almost the central banks of the world and those countries the are not represented , the of or is being prepared a war : the attack to Afghanistan was 7 countries , the ’ s attack Iraq was 5 , and bring Gaddafi only they four , but meantime Russia has counts the Central Bank the Russian .
Everything who has tried against this family died .
Abraham is declined is now revived the state the Central Bank of America the Rothschild , began during the War of Secession is now this money and was murdered at a 1865 the theatre .
Fanciful started this money and wanted suspending the reserve Federal ( States ) and was murdered at a 1963 ; the mr Louis was poisoned in 1936 and to exceeding now States the outrage the great economic crisis the 1929 .
Its be the global power them has the years 1859 - 1871 is now creating a plan with three world wars , designed the Albert Pike , François the determination to 33 .
The War the as to and States across Europe ; the wanted eliminate was colonial , especially the to , the third is there proposed reduce people the between half a million thousand of million ( be amount of slave for their welfare and luxury would and not of resources ) , are a religious universal ( the is the painstakingly constructed for better be solution ) and the final the powers resounding .
Is the it operates the look forward the poorest families richest , the Rothschild , the dynamics of the releasing of a crisis and the of send a solution (  - agenda will of the chaos ) .
They are , however , flawed , and threat always an in the situation . if not , enough should the States was created of repetition a constitutional crisis the 1907 .
So , of success the as about the total seat austro-húngaro , which Ferdinand , in Sarajevo and then to , the his position , facing the World War , tore the Russia having the beginning the revolution flank .
The World War over in unexpectedly and this unjustified military and economic , is the capitulation of Germany ( look forward wars to the Russia having were already unnecessary ) and the of firstly the great power of Central , the empire Austro-Húngaro .
Preparation for the Second World War , allowed are bankers and political palette , the bloodless , a situation over the look forward huge – this for a war imposed opinion of Germany , to were the privileged the radicalisation is there impoverished . subsequently , them sufficient with them in Germans the solution of the , we must was what strong enough and simple that is now ourselves , and build next be a Czechoslovakia states number of seasons and with and minority German should represent was that proper the fifth spine , we must the calls and Enquiry was the War .
About the total the century , even the Rothschild the of the movement , a to the of a Jewish state , out in the region the former with Jerusalem as capital ( return about the total ) .
The declaration prejudice this linkage previously laid foundation the mass immigration this is about Jews is now Palestine and they the conflict with the Arab population the .
Were targeted terror attacks it is by both sides .
The is difficult know whether Hitler consigned is be the what had control even the bankers international in principle or whether everything what we must did was part a . however , the suffering the European Jews the very concentration was the privileged the acceptance of Jewish the society World .
Israel was founded official at the 1948 and , the similar to at the – this for a war imposed is now Germany emerge the road to the , with the proclamation of people of Israel set the spotlight for a third War .
If we take them bankers international succeed , the nation Jewish , same the Second World War , was done would at the are paying is which , now with the Arab population or , generally , Muslim of the Middle East the midst .
Israel is a laboratory in , is one machine we have our solder and chaos , not only the of their country , but also at international . let us take example how was the individual way totally even the and its opponents people of Israel .
Does who is guilty and is the are paying the conflict palestino-israelí ? does the injustice marginalization a spiral of violence chestnut , if about the total it all was the greed of individuals and its be the global power ?
The is distinction the of Israel and its authorised , because , I can do the same is happening in our country , even the bankers international only inherently to candidates the elections .
The present of Israel B. netanyahu is the of political fascist , marketing in bankers international , we must ago the possible to the War of Iran and , considering that their iran is Member the of cooperation Shanghai ( China , India , Russia , Pakistan ... ) , threaten at the become a conflict global and , if a it iran controls the Straits of , me end where happened the 20 % the oil World ( the row as is only two miles wide ) , would is now the destruction the world economy .
On light are now as them David at the 1994 : &quot; the need is general crisis the people will agree with a new world order . &quot;
The new world order in your imagination is a world of Mr and slave .
A world the serves a handful of people the aristocracy financial well accommodated .
A world the every new individual the up chip about the total been controls all its be .
&quot; and forced everyone , small and large , rich and poor , free and slave , to a at the right or cope with , is now not able to buy bought , is now this will he of monster or the its .
It is necessary sack : who have it cope with , follow even the numbers of monster .
The number mark is now the person and this is sixty the &quot; .
Film element : if being crude oil , have Hollywood
In November we have our 1979 a group the demonstration of students from took Embassy American in Tehran and took 52 as hostage .
Putting this into freedom to be in of the supporting , the which after the revolution orhan is now EE.UU , country that had its regime decades .
The government American the situation not themselves any prospect was favourable : throwing the there is a be viable we was afford to , if doing , disposal in danger the confidence of its allies in other countries .
But we welcome the is even the hostage Iran on the , where the revolution had led at the theocratic regime , did to its extent .
Was a coup about the total prestige of , be said that later was done intensified even more the failed attempt free the hostages there is a .
Even the diplomats imprisoned were released 444 days later the intervention negotiating the Algeria .
At the EE.UU. , their destination was a wave of and bear against Iran .
The failure Iran on the played decisive in the defeat Jimmy cope with Ronald the presidential elections 1980 .
The film &quot; element &quot; the and actor Ben is this story , we must a small success for America .
Operation a before to the Embassy , was done escaped six employees the Parliament building .
And a rocket science , ended in the residence the Embassy Canadian .
Cia , in cooperation with the Canadians , managed extract in , to helped a story Sky is : forthcoming with passports Canadians , as the team film we must at the which the country to arm making a Who of it even have a science fiction .
Combination are
The plan that we Bourlanges expert in &quot;  &quot; be coordinated the collaboration we have our Hollywood .
For us to is prompt divulged , was the project film at the journals specialist , was done organised conferences the Polish press , the society we have our production virtual to even a clearance real .
Even the details the operation was done together at the secret for a long time , the film it from the memories Tony .
The catalogue of is a combination peculiar the mixing up .
For a they , a political realistic ; on the other , a &quot;  &quot; , the history of episode we must went well , a pretence ( an example be the series &apos; be push ) .
At the film was done combined the mind has taken hold . we for a they well it have our Teheran . at the sequence we have our appropriations are photographs flagship the events , we must were the way in the film ; do not have many differences to that regard .
The other , scenes authoritarian we have our Hollywood is more , marked by the irony and a corner excessive .
And moreover , of the be the CIA and other institutions : men we must you analyse the situation in us to set the negotiations , the corridors the office , there is a telephone ...
Ben has restart his career of way excellent .
The actor , that ridiculed , the become a director on and its way we must act longer has the white points ironic .
Element the third , and &quot; goodbye small , goodbye &quot; ( 2007 ) and the &quot; adjourned the session . town we have our honour &quot; ( 2010 ) .
At the same time , the first the catalogue of the Action is the town , is it .
Also , the sensitivity we have our warrant a was a feature we must light in managers films account for of gained of standards Hollywood .
And what shows at the element , where Teheran was done &quot; wheel &quot; the case in Canada .
To search for the best of the film have in the streets , at the reconstruction of the reported . the sequence introductory the Embassy is impressive for its capacity we must , at the same time , the taught of the confusion and lack been we must arises when , in place , the history of step forward .
And its colleagues obtaining a similar effect the scenes proceeded ( the team the bazaar we have our Teheran ) .
This is too action in many places
The had accept the to story explained does a that film the scenes more schemers .
And are complicated quite well . sometimes we are he adds something the reality : here not fellow everything the so you ( the stage of which threatens the airport we have our Teheran , the handicap a called America the search for unbridled After the its increased fares they a madness ) .
The we have our element is the revolvers we must from to show this is too action in many places .
Alan Donnelly and John have a role funny as colleagues we have our Hollywood , even though their resolute was done deserved more space and are not , or to , only in this .
There is a these the explanatory , the catalogue of lose a rough sketch dramatic , but is an is to continue with interested moderate , appreciate we look forward to their realisation and the style of we must appealing years old and Amina 70 .
But it collapse , that will difficult .
As reminder a story real and test the excessive be look forward outmoded the secret services , is it enough .
Rules to the whole we have our much flair , bananas and circus
The servant www.bankovnipoplatky.com , be said that every year is on the rates bank more absurd , now has chosen to announce the beauty opinion of &quot; the Rules to ideas more absurd of the workshop EU &quot; .
&quot; we are seen as happened then the whatsoever the EU to write be a quota of the 40 there is a of women at the posts of direction the European companies &quot; , he Patrik Lindén , the whoever the on .
The is , for example , the recent decision of the Court of the European merge policies insurance between men and women .
To , look forward women was done of best prices the in living because for objective of retail trade .
&quot; others ideas influenced of the workshop EU be proposals in this House we campaign for people far end of this year &quot; .
The election will of end of the in February 2013 &quot; , informed .
The regulations controversial the EU is , for example , the addition compulsory we have our about the total fuel we must , harms the environment ; other ban is the use are mercury of just because contain be a small amount of substance dangerous or deleted the size is cages for laying hens , the contributed about the total increase considerable of the price the eggs this year .
The criticised the proving use means the expression &quot; butter we have our it &quot; or the withdrawal from the garage classical the trade .
A banana passed its quality should be a length 14 centimetres .
The deep the Union take this type of is now often the pressure of one or other lobby law or industrial , whose demands at the Brussels are stood normally there is a some state or the States ( the Czech Republic , to the threat of a veto , eye requirements of banks ) .
That a lobby were behind the request , for example , the bananas more quality be in the EU be a length of the less 14 centimetres and not could present &quot; shifting &quot; .
The European Commission was done foursquare for should of only search in national standards not to date , we must only its marketing .
Rules do reference to fruit and vegetables the EU , in spite the opposition of States , been no relaxation EU the existing directive a waste grocery .
Mr they the on could the site EU the according which the much flair it market is with have are children under 8 years are not unlicensed is now the supervision of adult .
The EU was reference here presenting the study American the , when is toys , even the much flair the main cause of mortality there is an asphyxia .
Is also existing a restriction similar apply about the total use of the children to 14 years .
Born even in our country
Also absurd is the Rules corrective in European officials : everything an is patently proper official the EU cannot be against the name the Macedonian . for better not hurt the sensitivity is it Greece , must be given about fyrom ( FYROM of the Macedonian ) .
The servant Bankovnípoplatky.com , in cooperation with the we have our economists Liberals , in the right on , between some absurd proposals those COMs more top down , the site the Union the turnover is has cover the world food the territory of Member State .
The EU even the volumes were we have our has cover the world food we must can be the territory the Czech Republic the of our entry to .
Next , the Czech Republic estimated , for example , the volume established for better at the retains , what happened to a be an and fine substantial .
In organisers the on also them was commonplace will stop paying to countries are have access about the total Sea the idea give a subsidy the request for .
This kind ideas not overview at the Brussels but Prague .
&quot; we that there is a do not have Sea .
We European Union a compensation &quot; , declared be called during the autumn 2004 the then Minister of Agriculture (  ) .
What alleged the fact to in our the was a long grain and , to place have intervention , the state to even the stocks in and had exporting .
According , the Czech Republic is far the maritime ports , the EU should of millions of EUR .
At the end , the European Commission was prepared to help the Czech Republic and organised a public the buying of the grain the countries that have no access about the total Sea .
Subsidy to EU get be a was proposal the municipalities the Ministry to the whole local development target by the Minister ( US-DEU ) . specifically , is the wording of registered for Brussels .
Eu : look forward decided rare are there was one exception
Directives the Member States are often white form of criticism , to the EU in the regulations and , also , to and Development more they across the deserve to , according several experts , express our appreciation for .
The experts , the most serious is , for example , the charging for the EU for projects are have nothing to towards European integration , but the Member have the negotiations about budgets .
In Czech also them it the flax itself , the way to other countries the Union , the fight for the against the name of its products traditional , hopeful but our country not always Hague has been DE of .
Even the Czech , after six years we have disputes with German and Austrian , Bolshevik expansionism the name origin of the , but had christening he about the total rum national , whose tradition in our the back century , and the unfair &quot;  &quot; .
Only are that will of the distilled we have our cane sugar be board rum , but not those facts is now by beet sugar .
The consideration to appellations on from protected EU , the fruits feta from and gorgonzola known the world , the German city or Parma ham , are already for example look forward shortbread we have our resort , the we have our and , even , the from hop .
As protected EU , be proud of Europe the bread we have our the resort Before .
The people do not want save Rocco Derek Barnabei the , but am an amateur , claims
Mr Senator , how the was to the for better President ?
Is not be Senator or President .
If in our country it everything well , then not would my candidacy .
But no longer can bear the condemn the last twenty years in our country , how even the honour left go unpunished , was done increases taxes and the retirement .
Not to ambitions to political .
When see something that must not like to see you , tried to a solution it .
And the already have as years my candidacy is independent , the to be to speed matters is coming as Senator or President .
About the total Senate is , but operation a next the in road to the .
You is will be so on is now those who what had they been voting ?
Always I my candidacy the presidency depended the results the elections of the Senate .
Later that if was elected Senator , would my candidacy the presidency .
But my aim is not of the signal function ; the proper is the tool with the can do actually my own ideas .
The need the influence possible and he stronger .
The problem is not only be a nation that we criticize the bar or of television and film , it is now who wants to initiate is movement in .
To the are of communication , you discredit and who the free expression of with lying .
We have our me the I is now journalists or I was advisory Jiří .
We to his own ideas .
Is now fight presidential with i financial and responsibilities we political the declaration the property of twenty million .
To must change the .
As President is this competition and only the Senate the whole can propose laws .
How want tackle it ?
As citizen , I have part of the pressure to migrate the profession on was done Provisional Libyan as work be , and we .
The devil is in : if someone establishes a with a good proposal , it is or and , was done this to and this concerns the .
The independent , have a greater potential to the support of the Parliamentary group .
An or undistorted the , i have the ability in decisions an every party be better for our country and apply .
Does is regarded as to a man or coup leaders and ?
This Czech , is that people will come in i regarded as be left .
For me it , it a from the left or is .
What I is want forward .
I do not care if someone is or coup leaders and , I wish to be abreast the people .
Always support openly any solution good , regardless of whether the proposal next of the or the ODS and , the way , I the is bad ideas .
Ago joke when is Ud. we must is populist .
Does but is not demonstrating to says ?
The creates a business plan the company , you also certain objectives and ideals .
And them .
Will those who what something populism , but all the requirements the proposals that we i have now work the world or known experts speak them are under .
However the support the only he left slogans .
In cannot survive in a .
Or that they is to people and lot about to , will , for example , be a criminal responsibility and financial ?
Have other option .
To political , is now journalists the and try them that of my part that .
It elected President , not would problem in organise a broadcasting direct there is a TV in the right which would is now and the Parliamentary we must the criminal and financial for better political , officials , judges and prosecutors of .
And , good , them should communicate why do want .
If there is one like strong we must it marks look forward disputes , be done pressure we policy .
Take for case the direct election of the President , i think it was an achievement the public pressure .
At the same time tell am just an amateur , I do not an out intellectual .
For my views and ideals tried to seek allies .
Just to in and tried obtain the support to my programme .
Tried from to speed matters forward i myself same , but the not it well , in six years what contribution and I the private .
Sounds a as if it is now save the Czech Republic .
I do not any circumstances Salvador .
Know that with a person not I nothing , the I busy visiting cement kilns a number of protocol known , the is now the was done to apply about the total Senate .
I went to see , but declined because to a great deal of work .
For my part , the less I supported the journalist to , we must his the frauds with fruits covered we have our heating .
I I that is people is dissatisfied , now am at the biggest .
The sixty there is a cent the not turned out to polls and , those who have did , in representatives of the wake .
The Senate there are two the independent .
The people was the Senate , such way will be the rocket science achieve changes .
However , i myself defend my own ideas , as for example the election the mayors or for one will .
Is at be his own party ?
Not yet what i have because have time to , order to check the past unblemished out of every the potential Member the , not i have money .
Have money or the campaign the presidency , in my account transparent only there 20.000 billion .
Does has no money ?
About declarations the property , how is their ?
Clarification my private property in a few 60 million .
At the Prague i have is valued 25 million , an out valued ten million , another out at the eight million , be a now a rights with a value of ten million , a Martin the 3.5 million that valued in million , in of i have a couple to .
There is a true , i have a Martin because was my dream the . i am always pleased James Bond , we must seeing this car , was of women and , at the same time , elites against perpetrators including and .
Does will a Martin , their own property is valued at the 60 million and has no money the campaign ?
Ud. it to the but not to too money of .
Is not very convincing .

Does have ?
At the campaign have now I because 2.5 million .
The we must not have any circumstances shows there are no too was particularly interested my programme .
And have to pay regarding the campaign with value for money my home .
Even the to start with expenditure the campaign cover at the it get of salary Senator .
But could not live have . for example , could not pay to my child the school English , we must costs 30.000 billion month .
If just like earn money , then not i would the .
Does so will continue with its activity business to live ?
You has said to stop this activity ?
This is not in salary greater .
As I promised , to I a my activities .
For example , the of my to travel would it is going to be substitute in the spring .
The people problem we must the .
But I also need live it .
How purse strings they monthly as entrepreneur ?
Between 200.000 and 400.000 , I arguments .
It President , then cease even the business .
May put he was absolutely right interview at the issue of the Saturday we have our .
The will architecture shows the real adventures not only they and - the example the library and newborn despite &quot; mountain we have our books &quot; - 2 photos
&quot; i think that structure is fun , an aspect , and the there something interesting to &quot; , claims , be a killed is there is an outside .
And stefan Füle , technical you a company on the library , points : &quot; moreover , the is it &quot; .
But i wonder for better need a library the .
We all Internet , chlorine and books electronic .
No will enter there is a they those areas as libraries ’ s past fashionable , you ?
 , be a town bedroom on to at suggestion we must hardly deserves visit , holds the doubtful honour which levies with a record for better forget .
The people 80.000 inhabitants than the we have our literacy lowest i come from the Netherlands .
To this situation so PT Violence , ago some years was done decided in is to culture general and copying even the seven bridges fake they represented the notes euro in concrete arm .
The success the offensive analyses was finite .
And this responsible political you only there this could be handled for look forward statistics : what a it build library !
 , the architecture Dutch , everything a master the art the bars and responsible buildings funny we are Commonwealth , was the with her calmly and lively is now the presentation of the beauty in 2003 with five books the it and deficiencies the face .
And while the jury telescope Oswiecim to some and we have our shoulders , were is now up even the books there is a size its be a pyramid and brought its brief speech with the words : &quot; dear fellow :
Here the you have , my proposal the mountain we have our books , the Road Map &apos; &quot; .
Nine years later , the downhill race is we have our 30 the is at the .
This is of the draft revival , we must is in parking underground , a supermarket , an office of and a couple buildings housing .
At the beginning of November the downhill race is books was aung the second Prize &quot; Impact of NL 2012 &quot; .
Moreover , the is also about the total &quot; National 2012 &quot; .
That way , the small town sake in the history , to date no to nothing more must to area smartest that City ridiculously fingers After the whose which White opinions are to Central country , account now with of architecture contemporary .
But the , offering now the building cultural public view of its history .
The way to book
The first impression is of a paradise books under be a .
The true is to tell the lift we transported fair the collection centre of poisoned , the real awoke Dracula the reading do use , but do you prefer with his is now every step of their escalation the top .
The and is bright and easy to cover with the ground we have our mortar the elegant put are unequivocally the status public the library .
The built environment is perfect .
About the total raise a be to the park , dogs are guardian the children and playing football .
And by all ! books , books and .
&quot; normally look forward shelves we have our books are conversely the which and the be a room whites we must , we , is be a little be and impersonal &quot; , claims .
What we in us is to stop this classical configuration ESA and from the reading the about the total foreign .
The is very well tapped : the in look forward offices , the library of , the club we have our being , the education environmental the room up .
Finger is deserve special look forward shelves this to functions to work coating , and at the same time .
A , you and are strangers .
Even the architects and civil engineers the Day shake and when already about this material unknown .
&quot; we wanted work with recycled materials &quot; , we explains , the project at the town we have our .
And that as a day , an exploitation agricultural , brings us the animal feed adequate from the agricultural .
Have been blocked for many years , the greenhouses and the i come from the Netherlands used a fabric it scarce cable thick as basis for look forward roots crops .
Is of material cheap and efficient .
This fabric fine wielding two stations and then was done battled .
The library this fabric was done , there is a first time in such quantities , far this revised of four centimetres thick .
The and pressure to successfully , of it agricultural (  ) changing a little colour and it in material dark , harmonised and durable we must of that is a new car sport .
After the 105 corridor it the top the .
At the end this route continual almost 500 metres some the we facing to : since cafeteria not only is generated view city in the , it also be it a few tasty famous and its GM huge flower pots .
These for a we are keeping refer to the moisture air appropriate for this mountain we have our literature .
Donations for a new soul
&quot; hopeful but costs believe in large land as , this building is a project exemplary in the ecology &quot; , it marks .
The heating and cooling necessary was done are will for geothermal .
In spite of that mountain books is on under a pyramid live in glasshouses , even the more the sun only Addis Ababa over few hours the .
Look forward huge we have our wood a in mind now which live in glasshouses serve with shadow and indicating to the majority of to of the sun .
This creates a climate domestic .
The rest is pulled it .
Stefan Füle , the scepticism worker the is technology the information , the has dared to an in the new library .
And also been there .
Also , the teacher we have our medicine traditional China her been library . she is &quot;  &quot; the &quot; soul mention &quot; we have our .
The reason is that we , to the opening the couple weeks , was done invited to the town donate a book of their now private .
This is intended to fill , for the time , even the missed a library we must not yet we its archive complete ; at the present is 70.000 copies .
The concept has noticed .
Look forward shelves are teem .
&quot; there is nothing worse than going down that be a library the midst empty &quot; , claims the architect .
&quot; i believe you to initiative now the inhabitants have is link with Parliament .
All know that I his book of the library .
Hopeful but only is it embellish .
That way , the study has everything a success this discipline as the specialises known as &quot; an identity &quot; .
The town we have our a chunk the story literature .
Regardless the young and inspired be .
The is a for better shaping its identity .
: &quot; by the Germans must play a role more key &quot;
Germany the abstained the vote the admission of Palestine .
According instigation , expert in the USA . UU.-Europa , this at is now Berlin a position diplomatic quite tricky .
Deutsche : at the beginning for the weekend , Germany took is now understand would against the motion for give the Palestinians to observer a UN .
However , finally Berlin was done abstained .
Why do ?
Instigation : Germany is not the Israelis have done in Gaza .
The , to the special relationship we have unite the with Israel , Germany must be careful .
But at the same time I nor supports the American .
Germany wanted demonstrate its independence that too criticism with Israel .
During the embargo the in Libya in March we have our 2011 , Germany in abstained the to what was of an area the flight .
This has been avowed the NATO .
Does he is difficult is now Germany take the are at issues international important ?
Yes , that .
This is because we must are is hindrance its foreign policy , moving a policy led , the to , the United States and on a foreign policy German .
And we must difficult even more to speed matters is to that than we have no a policy consistent and uniform .
Is thus the , by the Germans in a crossroads .
Of them is expected we must play a role more independent , but not are used to .
I still are operating what role be , but have already started the road to a foreign policy &quot; normal &quot; .
A foreign policy to countries such as France or great to .
What do we mean specifically a foreign policy &quot; normal &quot; this German ?
That is a policy that , when is national interest , is ready stand positions differences of the United States or its European partners .
I the German foreign has and unsound in economic , it , the exports in its relations with certain regions , as be Russia , China or the Middle East .
Even the economic interests Germans the is differences of in others great powers and the reason Germany must protect their .
Does these economic interests have affected at the position proposed with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the vote of UN ?
For a they , Germany we large markets in the Middle East , the Gulf .
For this reason be poppy and not alienate the Arab public is not élite Arab .
This is important , of course .
But I not he would by importance the is not a relationship completely unilateral .
However , yes play a vital role this in its deliberations German .
Does has attacked Germany its relationship with USA . UU. about the total undertake not to vote at the important decisions as on Palestine ?
I in Europe , and even in United States , the German enjoyed of enormous of understanding .
For this reason , do not think it has is a complete break so drastic the case of Libya .
Perhaps to Germany that Leman is respect .
The , all this has not the to prove that it is a country to take into account the seriously as international actor and whose interests be take into account .
In Europe exist differences of opinion about the citizens initiative Palestine .
In , USA . UU. the shown in favour of veto .
Does there amendable we have our opinion between USA . UU. and many European nations ?
Always been these disparities to the domestic US .
I was the government decision at Obama shows at the secret a great understanding towards the European position .
But , and political situation it live here , it is the not can stand at the public that position .
I believe that genuine amendable we have our views is the which it he attaches .
If we the between Obama and the Prime Minister Israeli netanyahu , we Obama is not it himself with the .
Does he is difficult is now Germany reconcile close relations we must in with Israel and United States , for a they , with the position of main partners the EU , on the other ?
I is precisely this makes it so difficult the Germans .
Of course an easier the Germans if matters a single European policy consistent and allowing , but is not the case .
Is thus the , have no the possibility be part of Spain higher , it must into to speed matters from its own position .
This is precisely what we must are now doing the euro .
I in the future Germany will a leadership to force Europe take the European .
Of course that is not easy for Germany , it simply there is a relationship we must in with Israel .
This has always been an issue handles .
However I by the Germans have course we do must play the leading role on independent .
Is Germany to the role as an international actor important ? does wants to in reality Germany assume a key role ?
Or perhaps he still underdeveloped to so let us have some leadership ?
Germany not yet the have , always is you and , for obvious , the he still collapse play a role most important .
If we the from , for example , we and Germany must have was done I as actor main , when certain feelings .
This it is the Germans .
Is an old problem and no want be surrounded the countries our enemy .
Of this way , Germany is a position much more it United States .
Must show be an attitude inclusive cope with in differences of neighbours and views and that it is .
The influence US . UU. in European ever more and , but the EU does not cover for the time that we , does who still then ?
In Germans for will to assume a substantial role key .
Even if for like , if them is unpleasant or turns in people still more unpopular , c &apos; la vie !
Instigation is executive director the Academy transatlantic in Washington , be an institution we are in academics and experts policy from Europe and of the you analyse are together the challenges that transatlantic community .
Is moreover Member from the polls Marshall your , where the specialises in German political , foreign policy US and transatlantic relations .
&quot; protection of trademark &quot; at the China : when and drunk they suddenly you are trademarks Chinese
Drunk is a familiar of the Pole also .
But , is drunk Pole ?
After the behalf is be a designation EU official at the China but we must is not of companies original .
Not however , one enjoyed we have our protection the real not be a demand .
And even then is not clear that they will with the reason .
&quot; in foreign to and more difficult protect their trademarks in China &quot; , it marks he , lawyer of the specialises in of rights protection in the Far East .
On establishes a to my table a new case .
Even the imitators simply in a couple of points you to record their trademarks .
That way , it at the Lu-Gucci in the was done with Prada-Kny .
Are German in copied legally the same way , perhaps and as he has happened about the total manufacturer goods sporting .
Embarked a locked the have this covers seats the office of trademark Beijing .
The 14 September the entire 2010 a China which stated mark , it artificial we must in i the home fashionable .
Are Chinese are Champions world at the copying and of and cases where rights intellectual property is .
The cities exist stocks number plants dedicated exclusively the selling off of counterfeiting .
However , even the number of cases are in have . there is a of their customers , him fight against the office of trademark granted are official to Chinese the from a designation have is EU we .
Even the Chinese refer &quot; bang &quot; or mark his .
The word is of the term Chinese &quot; bang &quot; ,
We must ago reference to women that have &quot; fish &quot; a wealthy .
The Chinese authorities we feel guilty
&quot; is harmful the business , be fight against this &quot; , requires .
&quot; an ago waters , the position monopolist disappears and great deal of harm we must suffering the image is enormous . &quot;
The losses financial and the procedural the sectors affected are , in the case to flagship to .
According to statistics the company of analyses access to the market , in of 15.000 the it cost per year China is , at the size , the third market goods to and to overall is now greater faster tempo .
However , achieve the annulment of enrolment doubtful legality the of trademark hard and moreover is .
Even the processes be over far nine years and the outcome is uncertain .
About in the Court rejected be a demand because had Objective much time he this had become &quot; reality of market &quot; .
&quot; if the they is bad fortunately , perhaps even have to pay to because the process has done is now this at the China &quot; , it marks .
On this is a .
Some of are more known to graphic .
At the 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a he the manufacturer of machinery such , the company that had has been taken in the manufacturer German we have our bombs concrete .
The Chinese can continue to hold an emblem very similar the star Mercedes .
The seller we have our Volvo ,  , his at a logo is and blue we must had large measure is now BMW ; the subject was done in court and had amend it .
The manufacturer amount of laundry and lost at the China against imitators from Hong and Singapore which logo represented a crocodile eye in the right direction opposite about the total original .
The Chinese authorities we feel guilty .
The office of trademark in Beijing that 2010 been difficulties them because is a shortage and equipment funding of .
The last year , however , &quot; the situation of emergency labour the as usual &quot; .
That way , the mass of processes the actual complaint a by a 22 % .
Almost 57.000 of cases was done worked been cleared , a 75 % the previous year .
However , 81.500 complaints are continuing be for a resolution .
Fight against this costs is
As is be the China , the figures are surprising .
The last year the recorded be 1.4 a hundred and million from protection of trademark , almost a more the 2010 .
Would be a new record and means that China there is a tenth year running the list also have to assume new enrolment the world , according it marks the office of trademark .
To also to of which valid , that to 5.5 million of .
At the 2011 would 1.800 a hundred and million typhoon at the concept are .
In other is , this means this average every for costs 1.280 typhoon or 160 euros .
Fight against this costs is , perhaps and as shows the case of the family German .
Since for seven years the group principal in court a Chinese .
If the Germans have stop production in pieces car imitation ,
The has achieved ensure and cases where rights Chinese EU mark .
&quot; ourselves we have caused were because in Germany even the surnames not are protected &quot; , it marks , the president and we have our previously based in Munich .
The office of trademark also rejected the resource the .
The two following bodies he of the reason is now , but the still fronts working on at present .
Be great deal be careful
Now the case has come to doors of the Court to Justice , where remains outstanding for a resolution .
Entrusts to welcome the issue and extolls professionalising the courts .
However , also that &quot; the procedure is extremely expensive , so in terms of money of time &quot; .
It difficult estimate increases the costs internal ; the archive business has we must review a to hundred years old to or evidence .
Ago five years promised is now the be a &quot; there just under six in euros &quot; the goal to an agreement friendly , but not the .
&quot; this shows what us to care &quot; , it marks .
Even the dangers we must ageing dictatorial in the Far East threaten to affect to Europe ,
Specifically if we take them imitators was done construction there and cases where rights opinion of trademarks not protected .
So , a manufacturer Chinese tried record at home in Germany he for better shoes and products people .
Time ago the group occasion this field commercial , not however flocking in prevent the for .
&quot; be great deal be careful &quot; , claims .
So him the lawyer proposed to German be extremely careful the to do business with China .
But it is not enough to merely confidence in the international rules opinion of rights of , there is to is &quot; record in China everything will be for protection &quot; , perhaps and as points .
Otherwise the subject be much more expensive we must a simple registration .
In fact , at the case to scenario the assault of their battle particular , then be overcomplicating have to pay is now the rights or for its own behalf , perhaps and as explains .
This or the segment the we the .
Day World the AIDS : dance , I , help
At the Druckmaschinen trying the chorus in Swaziland was done delighted even the orphans of the AIDS

To depriving of their power to judiciary ?
In fact , even the 234 articles , whose the forced to assembly states 100 Member overwhelmingly from a meeting quality we have our 15 on the fact that at than , are truly worrying .
As in previous constitutions , the draft in it the for it is founded on the &quot; early of the Islamic law &quot; .

This was and remains open to interpretation and it looks are from are to this vague he , the for manoeuvre legal it honour , for better impose is stricter the Sharia .
This is at least what we must suggests a new article added : and issues relating now Sharia with put of Al-Ashar , the institution Islamic the country with a great power the Uighurs .

Mexico : Casas grandson have a beginning
On the incoming of Mexico , Casas grandson , was done for take office of their office , the correspondent the BBC , Bellamy , in the challenges will the new President and various of its population .
The traffic in of Mexico is especially there now .
A city the best circumstances , is already in itself , the installed the Monday an encirclement from is several is main roads they the city and is causing chaos is .
The goal , not however , was not to workers could to their place of , but to avoid demonstrators could to reach to .
On Saturday , the new President of Mexico , Casas grandson , will with presidential and will the nation .
Have a task very complicated .
Has gone established we economic over the outgoing we have our Felipe Calderón , but the country is undeclared a war against it has have now a few 60.000 lives at the six years .
&quot; my government is great to the Mexican of reducing the violence &quot; , he the Sr. grandson at the beginning this week about the total of United States , Barack Obama , the clearance shenanigans .
&quot; i to a new strategy of safety the it achieve that objective &quot; .
To that before the President the EE.UU. , the experience policy prior of the Sr. was as governor of their state home , the of Mexico .
A state very populated a rapid growth , we must surrounds it the capital ; look forward views the new leader are divided in this territory in he held stuck at .
A honest man
At the town we have our valley of the bravo , for example , the reminds with will .
Their resident he some it is on merit of smart growth tourism the and the lack of infrastructure .
To the town be drive to is new roads of the Sr. grandson , the enormous improvement compared poorly upgraded roads and by pretty bumpy were .
In can be seen Rachinel with his name in the modern and impressive Museum exponential the climate change .
&quot; we of him sine qua non to a real change and Sustainable &quot; , says his friend and ally political Mor irreplaceable , Member the Sr. grandson , the .
&quot; particularly , in it to security and economy , we await the interesting and the veritable change that we have our country so needs &quot; .
After the uninterrupted period we have our 81 years in power , the was there is a Vicente Fox in 2000 .
The Member accepts that these , After the 12 years the presidential palace the party there expectations to Casas grandson .
This also the rating the opposition ago is essence the President .
&quot; is a very honest , very committed an excellent vision the .
Is a fantastic man of state and , of everything , that is a who knows listen . &quot;
However , the state that is not that is many people on their former Governor .
At the , familiar also as town , the contrast with the streets we have our valley of the bravo not could not .
Under stretches Motorway of high is , in many ways , a suburb the own town of Mexico .
The problems of the Yevgenyevka are also hard I ask you ! .
At the beginning of this year was the intervention the military for us to commit on gangs drug which operate the areas and violence against women is particularly serious .
A strong , on and a waste , has an impression just for the last two years bodies we have our give you dozens women murdered .
Be 1.000 women were killed the of Mexico on Sr. grandson the Governor , is a much higher the town Ciudad Juárez , unfortunately for its violence and a place that is a on for innocent .
Even the critical of the Sr. grandson say , the cases , are it tackle the of the perpetrators on was in office .
The critical accusing to government to a blind .
A house of concrete , of housing estate , is to contain look forward tears on i shows of its daughter , order .
The official wording the facts , committed at the 2010 .
However , his family it is believed that couple the killed .
&quot; when i to home , seemed as if he would rolls the body &quot; , of Mrs .
&quot; had sign of that severe and the rigour have now appeared &quot; .
On his mother tracing the history , be a which we have our is noticeable since look forward walls , a cross in the it reads only word : Justice .
However , this is exactly what the family it the has denied .
&quot; the of i the it as be an old , be a , be a .
What they is that simply i what they say and it outside &quot; .
&quot; but surely this is that when have there many irregularities and by negligence &quot; , claims .
With presidential the grandson will on Saturday will accompanied a huge responsibility .
Of thousands families was done have affected by violent crimes been in Mexico the last six years and the new President has promised give them priority during their office .

My crisis of mexicano-estadounidense
That many were forced leave Mexico to the in the absence of opportunities
Even the Mexican tend beginning to criticise the were ; it request of in Mexican we have our those difficult times
Observing are mexicano-estadounidenses in between a rock two worlds .
In recent trip is now town of Mexico , hardly had down in this House we campaign for on and reached the refuse of immigration it was completely confusing .
A few notices did the road to two on : of &quot; Mexican &quot; and another for better &quot; foreign &quot; .
I was there a few seconds a be sure to where should go .
About the total be changed grew in California Central , over all my life I have out &quot; Mexican &quot; .
Is ethnic , the way of my friends we have our are to as &quot; Irish &quot; or my friends the York was done as to themselves &quot; Italians &quot; .
Later I decided there is a &quot; mexicano-estadounidense &quot; .
But this was Mexico .
And , at the fatherland of my grandfather , the of scenarios not were needed .
Simply was US .
I Spanish . what well enough to over an interview in this language .
But have of vocabulary of and not can assure that of my accent American .
So I my passport US and I at the EU we have our foreign .
Thought at the time this week in the president of Mexico , Casas grandson , visited the home White to meet the President Obama .
At the agenda is , as always it meeting and these two countries , withdrew : immigration , drugs and trade .
Grandson was look forward also speak about the advertising in the Mexican economy , one of the reasons are it a Mexican was done will been in Mexico as it unwanted to the United .
Want partner with United States and Canada and creating America is currently a trading bloc in the European Union .
Moreover , grandson promised continue to fight even the which the drug been in Mexico , but took details .
To Mexico , the relationship with the difficult and painful is we have our grudge .
Possibly the of US never been applied remember to at the 1848 the United invaded Mexico and his to leaders to the half of that its territory is at .
But the Mexican , think at the centuries , it is no minutes , even the elements it what request of are there is a .
So , the moment the official the United States says anything such the slightest criticism to support Mexico , to complaints , so in the press as the elite Mexican , on how Americans are the sovereignty of its neighbours .
The children of are this for a war .
And even so , to Mexico , the relationship that I really is challenging task is the have the 35 a hundred and million mexicano-estadounidenses we must living the United States .
Does we grudge ?
There a long .
At the Mexico have winners and losers , people for the country provided opportunities and others are that .
The reason to there it is people Hungarians Mexican living cities the Los Angeles , look forward , as , Denver or St Antonio Di Pietro is that , in the our tree , there person , it the mother or one the grandparents , now it he closed the front door is opportunities been in Mexico and took I have to leave the North .
The of the person fit in profile particular : skin whites , a of studies under , from a people poor , etc.
We their see and loyal .
To support Mexico not .
And , in spite of that I thought that perhaps we from now the American dream American , about the total could have gone is now good neighbourly schools and have good business , we never lose view we are to experiencing the American dream American , and not the Mexican .
Is to sometimes our identity is clear , but our bay it is .
Is the United States .
Moreover , we that many the Mexican is the elite the class leaders for .
The sense is mutual .
We are a reminder of a defeat humiliating and watching us there is an over of the if about category than that is not sufficiently Mexican .
Our Spanish never it good enough and our ties with Mexico be sufficiently strong .
A see , our existence is a failure .
If our families would not failed been in Mexico , we would gone .
And now us not be trapped the Iron Curtain we have our wrap , from well the United States but , even so , as souls .
My wife , we must he Guadalajara and wine legally the United States when was a girl , i reminds there this Mexican and mexicano-estadounidenses because the knows with more strength who are and the latter to Der Spiegel .
Hopeful but is citizens of , she is regarded as of two countries .
Meanwhile , many mexicano-estadounidenses know are of no two .
We love listen about the total group Mexican even the Tigers the , but also is now .
You the up to each country , but be solid is now any them .
At the Mexico we are as US .
In the we regarded as Mexican .
Now , making life more even more to speed matters , the I have during my trip , some leaders Mexican and intellectuals want to return connecting with the diaspora .
They want to are mexicano-estadounidenses work as &quot; ambassadors &quot; of Mexico makeshift , been their interests with what was .
To colleagues US what wonderful feeling that is at that country and in political leaders for us to their links with Mexico .
Yes , course ...
That is to .
There too grudge .
And , with the unequal for , is about corruption rampant and instead of violence drugs , many of us we are not so in be a country wonderful feeling .
I fear that we you ! Sötét is now be alone with this idea , remember that .
It is fair .
If some Mexican even are not prepared to the United in this House we campaign for the way were to support Mexico a century and a half , then they accept a number of mexicano-estadounidenses even be begrudgers there is a how was to relatives a less time .
 .
Perhaps let us more &quot; Mexican &quot; the thought .
This battles , new Middle East the midst
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas well be a basis operation a likely the peace
Are you able be changed one day a lasting peace between Arab and Jews at the Middle East the midst ?
Another stop blood we must it would seem any hope is in vain .
In the midst is useless and arise further opinion of who started first , there are countless buildings have been reduced to rubble ; be 140 Palestinians , of civil , the Israelis have been murdered , there is a first time , rockets from Gaza have fallen some Tel , the scorning people of Israel , the holy city we have our Jerusalem .
But , the Israelis the Palestinians to sections in your former conflict , everything as them surrounds it at the Middle East the midst is changing .
The Arab spring what has an everything in dirty whether you or not , Palestinians and Israelis have trapped the mighty fuss regional .
Perhaps this for we must their fight it even more bloody to .
However , is for better that its lethal situation of media in could .
A war is not earns
In , the optimism appear to now very difficult justify to the .
Even if is the ceasefire agreed 21 of November , even the clashes of the week have strengthened in hawks of both sides .
And Hamas , is Islamist the centre Gaza since 2007 , have be changed to even the Israelis forced to withdraw from , in spite of that saying that Gaza been a good him .
Of the have killed a of leaders trouble pressure in 1.7 million of Gaza in the protests more townships and bound of the planet , Israel not has to Hamas .
In fact , Hamas is gaining ground in West Bank , the of Palestine now ruled for your implacable rival Fatah , the Palestine more moderate .
Moreover , and Hamas could the conclusion the time is their favour .
Has turned Islamists to have gone arguments influence the Arab world , Hamas has in richest and powerful .
Turkey , be a power regional that he had previously been the American ally Muslim more near called upon Israel , has espoused the Hamas . it Qatar , the States and most dynamic of the Gulf .
Even the of Hamas say the EU average order Islamist is crusade Israel , the Lebanon about the total North , where dominates the partido-milicia  , by Syria , where the rebels a trend and more Islamist could bring by , to Jordan , where even the allies we have our Hamas are threatening about the total King .
In the with of Israel , the in the Muslim by the in Egypt , the most populated and fundamental the Arab countries , has changed balance the region .
Hosni Mubarak , the guarding we must period in Egypt over 30 years until his nemeses at the 2011 , not took too time for Hamas .
In , the Muslim are cousins we have our Hamas and its leaders more dependent on the it .
At the future action diplomatic , to Hamas arise as key to not be ruled out , even Israel the United States .
Meanwhile , the arrived wielding people of Israel sorry the conclusion opposite .
In we must the military , have because Hamas towards participation in your place .
The system missiles or people of Israel has proved its worth and many of rockets Hamas have been destroyed .
Even the Israelis more calmer ... for some time .
The as , United States is more firm we must never ; many European countries also Hamas towards participation that started the wave of violence .
The , israel has been . especially the government decision at Benjamin Netanyahu , a Prime Minister the ignored widely the cause of peace .
Hopeful but even the rockets fired from Gaza have over with is a few 30 Israelis since 2004 , Israel has not had many terrorists suicide bombers , thanks to now barrier we must West Bank , the chunk of a territory aspiring is now become state of Palestine , and it even the Jewish settlements we must continuing in spite of the international rules , be effective illegal .
The Sr. netanyahu , whose party fighters the United a group an online even it by in the to elections 22 of January , the good position .
Why do those Palestinians a state own ?
If we really at the West Bank , you rockets perhaps and as have done its compatriots in Gaza ?
Is better ! After the wall and them a coup if rose and .
Perhaps will the arrived wielding , even if the Arab spring could tamper their calculations .
Hopeful but even the from we must take of power in Egypt in other are not have too love Israel , their priority will tackle look forward internal difficulties .
The budget of Israel is the on their four neighbours Arab together .
To initiate a war with the superpower the area hardly will the new governments Arab improve their economies .
The May Sr. Hague has worked with Barack Obama to firearms is well and could usher the it .
To Israelis should a .
With the Arab world inventive more democratic , depriving the Palestinians of their right of is creating a powder keg which a day the territories occupied by Israel , the same way that week constable a bus at the Tel .
The repression have now destroying is opening for democracy the Jewish state and let us look at demography is deteriorating the situation as Arab population .
Look forward missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas towards participation they a toll diplomatic in .
Both sides need a right a million people which conflict .
The solution remains the people sensible of both sides , the majority of the outside world and paper : two states the afford we have our territory the Israel for cancelled for security .
The expectancy , small in the short term , is that it a be boost people and foreign that they are fighting this .
Egypt , we must should be to stop the of weapons in Gaza , with Turkey and Qatar , is was a unprecedented situation to Hamas to i the idea of Jewish state based are 1967 , with order of land and a Jerusalem shared .
Even the Arab spokesmen issue and not before time should also pressure Hamas and Fatah is opening to join .
This help the of a Palestinian state the spelling to obtain be a category the virtual in the right UN .
The Sr. Obama also has an important role in be to Israel now table the .
During their first office present its own Plan the peace .
We have our the home White , appear to the reticent is now unique its attention .
This attitude is deplorable and vision .
A Middle East the midst stable is in the vital interest the United States .
This involves an agreement cause of peace between Israel and Palestine .

In world constantly networked , is not as bad dull a
The testing is are thanks of this year , are unexpectedly had to five hours in airport because the aeroplane the suffered a real problem engineering and had wait that waited another .
So had great deal time for platitude .
Not you ! i lying .
Half a day in airport waiting for it a flight is quite boring , even if you resources to be Have , as books , journals or , an ignore is shops duty-free .
But and there is more academics and experts the child we must praising look forward blessings of the platitude .
According them , we and as our children , we and .
Dull obliges about the total brain to options interesting and can encourage the creativity .
Have , now , the of we connected to this or that screen , we not .f we must provided the platitude .
So , does should accept we have our good mind the platitude ?
Yes .
And not .
But , have now we that later .
The , same that many people , supposed we must , now we must have more time to leisure , the platitude a phenomenon relatively recent .
But , perhaps and as claims Peter , professor in the history Greek and Roman the University Calgary , the case in Canada , and author of the book &quot; : is now &quot; ( &quot; the platitude , a story encouraged &quot; ) published in 2011 there is a University reporter , not that .
&quot; in fact , the history of the platitude is very wide &quot; , claims .
The walls we have our exist Latin the platitude we must dating the i d.C.
We also ourselves how define the platitude .
&quot; the problem is that has defined and we have discussed very different ways &quot; , that John D.  , as the University York at the , canada .
After the examining look forward on premises and raising the idea first a discussion in 100 people , the teacher and its Members defined platitude the experience we have our &quot; unsatisfactory , but not able to , participating in the of you full &quot; .
Claims the difference between the platitude and apathy is that people the something but want do .
That with the apathy there is the to something .
The experience main of the platitude , claims , is &quot; the at the attention , associated a under on and due to a that time is running slow &quot; .
The platitude May sound painfully it to depression .
However , the teacher it , hopeful but be able be about , to are inhuman tend is now see the matter for the environment or parts of the world , the to are exceptions that have it them .
Sometimes we are we boring , it is happening this is have the our .
In your study &quot; adjourned the session : in of &quot; , published in of September the magazine on Meat , the teacher and its Members were is now an experiment the previous involved be a cut a member of saturation change to Article a magazine .
Some group heed in the right room neighbouring a programme we have our TV it turnover are bore any relationship , other what heed with the volume under , so just as hardly was noticeable , on the third group did not listen audio at the no time .
The group here the with the volume under more daring platitude are other two groups ; them took hinge on , but were not in why and about the total platitude .
&quot; when a difficult task or interesting , the at the attention May wear an about the total platitude &quot; , pressed Mark J.  , as the University , at the , and the originators the .
&quot; the , when with doing something boring , as detect pieces unprepared a line with the manufacture , be a music you can help not &quot; .
&quot; in fact , now we know ! or do , be the are as of platitude , can in reality help combat , it do this person is physically more vigilant &quot; .
&quot; look forward research shows those children to they allows stuck at learn about more and observation more information forced be static &quot; , a teacher .
Everyone we know the dull in time the delay of aeroplane , a speaker spin , a film especially uninspiring .
But some people have more trend towards targeting the dull we must others .
To , some researchers proceeded the 80 be a &quot; scale of trend about the total platitude &quot; .
The scale include issues as &quot; much of i have to are repetitive and &quot; and &quot; there much i am interested that I do not have time this everything &quot; .
Instigation , as the University West Florida , hold such regional , the have discovered that boys have more trend towards targeting the dull the often the girls , and specifically need more stipulation external and diverse .
But , even the adolescents are a type we have our group it boring the easily .
At the 1991 ,  , a teacher on human and of Illinois , has the experiment in the disposal contact at the with 400 adolescents a between seven and eight times the through a search .
Found the 32 there is a cent of adolescents said it on was in the school or doing duties , on the 23 there is a cent said it when not was in the school .
The , the 3 there is a cent of parents were it .
The teacher said that he did not knew if we take them rates platitude current , 21 years on little , would over or lower .
But told are do was &quot; the adolescence is a period the platitude high its correctness highest &quot; , the part to you that both in children as adolescents in not they of control about what who make .
So , back the question of the principle : is good dull ?
Sometimes we are is not , it , taken about the total Far , can the exposing is now physical risks absurd , as be or let the consumption of substances method combat , perhaps and as shown look forward on .
The , many scholarship and speak the platitude the creativity , according a teacher , the consideration this issue over be two decades .
&quot; the platitude is have that time the brain we have our word we be doing anything other &quot; , says fringes , as the University the York .
But the brain not always know what it more appropriate .
If with boring and you that energy for better touch the or cooking , this you hover satisfy .
But if you television and film , that you thirst for in the short term , but not a .
&quot; so , if your child is boring and he Give an iPad , it , but will learned the hard way hands for or &quot; , a teacher .
And &quot; that are implemented is now other situations &quot; , it marks .
Your child not only learns is now hands there is a , it learns is now unchecked better in other areas .
Is really want complementarity the platitude .
But nor should be too critical with him .
Our aim should be , to , on be favourable paragraphs of the rumour constant is activities and technologies .
The teacher the .
&quot; to way we , need more , but the platitude is a desire to too distressing and disturbing to linked a it this &quot; , claims .
That what the people actually search is a way of disconnect and enjoy a time died .
&quot; at the we constantly &quot; , claims , &quot; it is difficult find ways we should focus to the noise by &quot; .
Mistreated : a book of the new law on migration use marijuana
 , student we have our 19 years in a Community and exalting of the Asia request , have a process criminal there is a something that must will soon legal the state is of a few stones marijuana and a René Magritte his for better .
It a day of September , he and some remember that there is the plains registrars now frontier of Kansas , times past when stopped the police .
The police found marijuana the car and a time next received a summons by there is a of drugs articles about ( crime age we must threat every one be a fine we have our 100 USD ) we are in the Detectives the of the trial .
&quot; they treat us as is now criminals &quot; , says .
What it ?
The weeks the following the vote the mistreated the legalisation the possession in of marijuana use hand , the answer at the many hundreds causes age there is a possession use of drugs depends on less the we must location .
The many hundreds crime age there is a of marijuana are overwritten so here and the Washington , is adopted a similar measure .
Even the departments we have our police have the charges against elderly 21 years there is an office is now a , it will legally once the Hague has entered into the weeks .
But public we have our districts more in request been committed to forward with are open there is a of marijuana and still are quote : .
At the same time , various cities , from suburbs of Denver the mountains western , are voting for better to prevent checkpoints shops we have our marijuana , it recently , in their communities .
&quot; all this is changing so quickly we must do not know need it as follows &quot; , told Daniel J.  , of the head police at the , fair the we have our Denver .
Those who is regulations the Washington are also quibbling issue and not before time .
And are continuing for advice to establish a system of compulsory licensing production , manufacture , distribution and sale ; it before to when the deadline , the 1 set for December 2013 .
Say , to or for , mistreated is ahead the of the regulation of the use of the , first with at and now – for better use hand .
&quot; mistreated offering of market more regulated , so a good on &quot; , claims Mr E. Smith , the spokesman control of the alcohol of Washington .
But the Sr. Smith accepts it place or system only can suggestions about what that it might function .
&quot; there is a veritable precedent the appropriate as &quot; , claims .
The Washington , Road Map I-502 , will enter into the 6 set for December , what we must is also a year during the which was done between two waters , the system of compulsory licensing that state not yet will , but the office will legal .
Moreover , there are some issues mechanical delicate be over that period , the way to a balance between demand of offer &quot; adequate access &quot; is now the authoritative and its ban to business cannabis in radio than 300 metres we have our schools , parks , of game children or are .
&quot; at the any circumstances place will more difficult business we have our cannabis for we must the urban areas , the city area President the Seattle &quot; , says Ben , spokesman the to the whole cannabis legal , a group to created recently .
The 21 of November ,  , the of the head police , sent a to and police the you Detectives the tax the town cease there legal actions there is a very of marijuana : over 21 years and the police cease the charges against these crime &quot; with immediate effect &quot; .
The of the head police told they was done away to the regulations the town regulates as marijuana with at therapeutic and begrudgers to persecute traffickers and sellers drug .
The county we have our , in the north request , the district , Ken , is a stricter .
The vote , was assured we must his office solitary persecute are of marijuana , primarily pressure the consumers and it have to treatment .
Now , 119 people are is now charges there is a of 56 grammes or than marijuana , even though many of them have other charges .
&quot; our office is why there action judicial proceedings against those one we must the moment the there was crime &quot; , told the Sr. in a statement .
The answer has been very complicated even in the county rural we have our table , where even the voters rejected the citizens initiative EU legalisation the marijuana .
The were Grand , the town of the county , have quotation is now adults there is a of small quantities .
 , tax of the district county government seat , supported this decision , but to not underestimating no cases pending there is an office .
&quot; i do is not it time about the total continue to doing to comply the law until i think this changes &quot; , said .
In spite the 55 there is a cent of voters supported the measure , never considered to use marijuana for better use hand about the total within of the government and the by it going to be easy .
Look forward contradictory reactions we must emerge the state familiarity with be a marked ambivalence among the regard to experiment using in this .
&quot; is barrier cultural with public of the district &quot; , claims be effective , a by his lawyer Denver which in accused there is a of marijuana and that is spokesman local the Organisation national the reform the EU .
&quot; the much time as is now people first the we must , in reality , still cannot accept be legal &quot; , said .
About the total be the States they look forward quantities small we have our marijuana the same way that if it alcohol , mistreated and Washington being for better become the number of cases test of the legalisation use of drugs .

Singapore search babies for better save the
Even the blaming the race , the stress and cost is property the education there is a not having children .
&quot; the people Singapore needs grow &quot; .
Am a husband murdering , you my wife , what a do with our duty civic be living !
May appear be that these idly be effective of an announcement tablets , but in spite of that - or perhaps to this - the webstreaming was done returned at the YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year .
Look forward i of a rap we must used no local as &quot; we in (  ) the oven &quot; be a laughing the rate birth Singapore .
The of we must was webstreaming ,  , thailand hosts the hope that it will after all the announcement forgetting draw attention to the problem a way funny .
Their chief executive creative , Hamilton , it wanted very of power the music for the people ! &quot; to national &quot; .
This is purely of , so had do fun and funny .
Is the problem of .
We are amongst the worst of the world at the ourselves to the others , so we that was an issue which we tackle .
Knew there was the had tried a , as launch perfumes with or organise we have our from carriers ( speed-dating ) .
Many these ideas can have creative , but not necessarily worked .
So we , why do we not do more creative to overcome this problem , that is a rap ?
1.2 children
To it take so this is the government decision at Singapore .
On $ 1.300 it cost per year at the political serve to encourage the going to have more children .
A parcel of the for better marriages and parents make far 15.000 dollars there is a as , Scientologists or look forward licensing leave and spread profits prosecutors .
But all this has operation an effect .
Singapore that is a town state rich and the technology the from Asian , also familiar the for of leaders and needed controls social .
The we have our birth Singapore , on your division national the , is now 1.2 children there is a women .
The last time they had here of 2 -conocida as was that rate reposición- was in 1976 .
So why do even the have no more children ?
So , there the and family the division national the , it says in &quot; best education &quot; and &quot; a wider range we have our of career &quot; .
&quot; this he has to people have a wider range options on of living and priorities , more from marriage and be a family &quot; , explains .
These changes the social standards have contributed about the total increase the , of remaining the births , what it the be a in the birth in Singapore .
Meanwhile , a policy of immigration EU at gunpoint to this to the population has created umbrage the local population .
In Singapore there websites where rife the xenophobia hardly disguised against many new immigrants , in particular even the Chinese , to critics to low wages and not integrated .
To immigration also is seen as one of the reasons the last year party won the had been a head of government Singapore chilling its terrifying election result the independence .
Since the there has been to correct the quotas and taxes higher the foreign workers .
Consequences some
The at the we have our birth is effects known the economic growth a nation , even the tax revenues , even the costs health the political of immigration , the example of Singapore also it is having some consequences some .
The government is not built many houses small .
For example , to affect the estate .
The authority on urban the to of over apartment small , known as &quot; cash of shoes &quot; , we must can build in certain areas the town .
These over apartment have land we have our 46 square metres and been a success we have our sales .
However , there concern to be able promote a of living and in developers want build houses large , relatives .
But Lee Soon , of the buildings the , it their &quot; boxes of shoes &quot; are much more quickly the units the .
Are more popular , the it the units was done exhausted days , even weeks , more quickly the units more size .
This makes it much better for our at cash .
However , accepts the new standards on clearer guidelines the developers , in to they disposal obstacles if wanted offer too small units in project .
Too
Singapore that is a town state .
To these new rules be a step the increase in the birth national , about the total spoken to the those the financial district the prompt are to a long effect .
&quot; the people is very Marge , look forward houses are clear and an is the education , the many people are they &quot; , says a young Executive .
Other people can have children .
&quot; but for me it is important to my own money and time &quot; , says another young the 20 years .
Men and women mention his career , the stress and cost is property and education as to them from having children .
So , there is an about force its citizens to children , when it to babies , even the are those who have the word .
What private found is on
Privacy .
The – the real Academy Spanish is quality private or &quot; the scope is of private life it is right to help protect from massive intrusion &quot; .
Is private for a retail trade we have our 16 years ?
How applies this definition in their daily lives and the social networks ?
Can even the dangers to is described there is a on moment said that surely not of online ?
Malashenko is now five boys the 15 years , users frequent the .
In four the cases , use the term is now &quot; something very mine &quot; , the personal level , and &quot; at the key and behalf of the user &quot; , when what applied is now social networks .
&quot; my secret deeper not even the going a Post &quot; , says Borg , when try to explain the of private at the are as facebook , Twitter , hotmail and Windows Live , where is accounts have been blocked for two years .
&quot; are secret very , my you May it , but not the world &quot; , claims .
At the scenes on fine or games with each other .
I am also with my known .
&quot; not be a photograph we must not be mine , or one for is be doing of ourselves &quot; , says .
As that is publish photographs , a million people bare , we have our crimes or write comments humiliating violence .
Borg ensures of in 35 the friends at the and many followers Twitter .
The majority are relatives .
The mother is including , is key of that .
Twitter for better case it interesting .
&quot; do not know whether i , i myself only even the &quot; , adds .
&quot; are social are humorous , can speak with relatives distant or with my friends in fast &quot; , that .
Not the answer that he would never accept a request a member of unknown .
Or he do case it to recognise a strange .
The case of José , we have our 14 years , is different .
The girl has accounts open at the hotmail , facebook , circumspect and Ask , the accepts not know 20 of people in your list of friends .
&quot; not frightens me , because we something in common , the music for example &quot; , that .
To child , none it hinted or has asked for the direction of their home or number of telephone .
&quot; if I or what they are simply together that of my account &quot; , recognises that .
José was he we have our Ask , then to a recommendation in Twitter .
About the total child you yourself not are foreign look forward experiences to today known as .
Is now a my her what were a network social .
What it and he demanded money .
&quot; never it who was &quot; , ensures .
The are paying , according José , not closed of .
&quot; only he it privacy &quot; .
Then explains a number of leaps and bounds for better assess the of that .
The Borg , this saddened going photos we have our known in uncomfortable or putting .
Is do , if I you wrong or he i have wish .
&quot; hopeful but know that is &quot; , claims .
Questions key
 , masterpiece we have our English and graduate at the education learning , be for better guide in children and adolescents in should the purpose of are social is provide information .
&quot; Internet emerged as a to seek information , but the of are changed rules of the game &quot; , mentions .
It marks the academic BEF , degree at the there is a University we have our and author the work native and immigrants digital , coined these terms to explain the phenomenon .
Even the native digital are them , even the and young we must born with the .
&quot; we created it immigrants digital have teaching of , when still we to &quot; , says .
Observing the topic is complex , &quot; because they we encouraging have a similar criterion defined opinion of need appropriate or not salvage , publish or to be a will be older the expression is this &quot; .
&quot; also be was it more them is be popular , a village thousands of friends without thinking the consequences &quot; , adds .
The specialist , is most effective by what exactly is good privacy aimed at children and adolescents the questions are ! think again .
&quot; they do for does &quot; ,  .
Next , lists some options : there are such things you yourself not a strange , why do what pensioner on ?
Or , you like we must now be a photograph you the of friend ?
Does know what the other are opinion of we ?
When labels photos we have our testing , does permission to other people for better ?
And a more , does everyone are know what with doing every time ?
Another point is them see be we as are found .
Are the same rules .
&quot; opinions are the Internet she with respect , morality and other principles , as be the social networks &quot; , claims .
Surveillance
Piñuel Villalón , professor university , a teacher in and consultant Kim Valentin education , observing we must is it up to parents and read is now awareness of those policies is social networks .
About the total understand every the them have the foundation sound foundation for speak with their children the implications we need to open be an account on .
&quot; for example , the age and is allowed share or publish &quot; , says .
With the Piñuel Villalón , is key remember in children to the lesson of &quot; not meet &quot; .

Peru is the you of the regional bloc .
&quot; should be from Europe to integrate be a citizenship &quot; : Heritage Correa
The of Ecuador , Heritage Correa , said today the citizenship common is target we are in &quot;  , in this case yes , must learn of &quot; .
Correa , who in the right I saw summit presidential the Union Nations ( Unasur ) , held Lima , declared is now the State TV peru to that than we &quot; was done killed at the &quot; in other conflicts , &quot; but now are almost a homeland &quot; .
Foursquare for , that sense , the of the citizenship we must encouraged countries of Unasur .
&quot; there to free people and employees for any country , as already happens with those the Andean Community , but there are still sectors to restore about the total past &quot; , warned .
The Ecuadorean was , moreover , in favour of the up of American States ( Authorised ) the premise of reducing influence the Continental and in account to have signed the Pact san José the Rights .
The on university never themselves to anything and , in , us even the what arrangement everything .
&quot; this is incomprehensible the Commission which are Human Rights is in Washington the funding of United States &quot; , said at the to political asylum has turned there is a Ecuador founder for , Julian Assange .
Correa was assured are is this decision because with it has betrayed their early , but the respected its &quot; profound democratic values and Rights &quot; .
But we must , in your time , &quot; had suspicions to Assange it extradited a third country and not it its process &quot; .
Reputed , moreover , that Swedish there is an observance it able in your territory about the total interrogation by an alleged crime sexual when &quot; the legislation itself Swedish allows satisfy through video , it could do the Embassy we have our Ecuador I shall be in London &quot; .
Correa said there the risk the deteriorate the health physical and mental Assange .
&quot; not I talked to him is on our Embassy , is her i informed I a small problem allegedly , nothing serious &quot; , told the event Ecuadorean .
What do there is the danger the deteriorate his health physical and mental there is a be he in space small a to exercises in free .
&quot; this complicates the health of any person &quot; , But .
Correa pointed the solution about the total asylum orientates is now Assange since June at the Embassy I shall be in London , by reducing the granting of to travel Ecuador , is the great to , Sweden and the European legal it been discussions with London in search a solution about the total of the founder for .
Us not negotiate with Rights , that word we not .n this case , but been assembly discussions .
&quot; the problem is the great to , Sweden and the European legal because the lawyer Assange , Baltasar , is a number of proceedings in different bodies European &quot; , mentioned .
And opinion we must &quot; if great to appreciate the morning the convince this it &quot; .
And if Sweden , as perfectly May its legislation and as has done in , about the total Mr Assange in the right Embassy we have our Ecuador I shall be in London or what way Skype morning same it this problem .
Correa availed for better assert a proponent of the press and to does is &quot; the mediocrity , the bad faith the lie , we must weaken the free expression of &quot; .
&quot; even the elderly to freedom the Polish press we not .re the political villains and wicked but one journalists at the proper of the profit , the blackmail the extortion &quot; , told .
That aspect was done welcomed have are not these journalists &quot; not bankers the hegemonic and class the dominated is now Ecuador &quot; , and forward we must to his &quot; at the revolution for continue the way the direction right &quot; .
Correa also supported the decision to the veto to Paraguay at the Unasur at least to their forthcoming elections , about the total argue the authority &quot; be firm and not to tolerate opportunism and fraught we have our legality &quot; because in reality &quot; shall the legitimacy the democracy &quot; .
The Ecuadorean was , moreover , &quot; perfectly be &quot; the will of its response , Juan Manuel Santos , we have our negotiate now with nicaragua the maritime between two countries of fault the Court International the has , we must influences the sovereignty maritime .
For the moment we by that fault .
Is a problem between a country facilitates and one .
Even the conflict are inevitable , but must be overcome in this House we campaign for the walking together .
Be them are a wide for better resolved and to .
Also employee at the conclusion is of the dispute there is a limits maritime have in Court Peru and Chile and opinion &quot; is correct for better Latin America to seek international bodies if have countries themselves to accept fault there is a hard be &quot; .
At the reference to the possibility it present the presidential elections in Ecuador for better to seek a third office running pointed documents of that possibility &quot; to optimism and joy , even though on some sometimes is quite hard &quot; .
Correa was assured that if lose even the at we have our February of the 2013 was done will the public life .
In personally never i has interested of power , but in situations so unfair as the Ecuador that poverty highlight only be correct the political power .
&quot; my movement believed that it was i myself who defaults that likely victory , therefore we accept that &quot; , told .
We have our earning would my finally period in the and that are of public .
If we lose as .
&quot; is a decision &quot; , said .
Correa referred the new of health of the President which Hugo Chávez in Cuba .
Just spoken to the of which Claus and i it was a treatment have was planned , we have our routine , it expectation pass the campaign to cuba is .
&quot; does not mean meant the within the health of the President Chávez &quot; , a .
The Ecuadorean part today in Lima in the right I saw summit of and the Union Nations ( Unasur ) we must brought with called a greater regional integration for better holding the progress , the equality and security .
Fatalities there is a AIDS today are a detection mention
To 21 years of when he anticipated the test : AIDS positive .
&quot; was as if I liked be a bomb &quot; , the useful the announcement , the doctor he do &quot; more &quot; , a clear success .
Child what kept to family .
Decided done office only of their disease and started needs opinion of she ; with perhaps plays have its birthday 43 .
Is , certainly , the wealthiest patients old the unity of HIV of the hospital civil Guadalajara (  ) , the came at the 1994 and several battles .
Lives with and the line human ( HIV ) have been blocked for 22 years , something to imagine at the beginning the 90 , when had have , few options we have our treatment and stigma .
Then , far the clinic of the blackout to &quot; because be an off &quot; .
Then , a village AIDS was a death .
Now that survive is now this syndrome and do with of living .
However , ignorant of their disease , there are many people on coming when and has already rife , &quot; reached &quot; its immune system and are victims of opportunistic .
Is now 31 years the appearance and of the AIDS the world , at least the first cases reported , &quot; the great achievement mean the of patient as treatment in well the general population , is just as &quot; , pressed the unity of HIV of the ,  , After the he this information was Therefore in April of this year a publication scientific .
And expert at the HIV / AIDS , a year 2008 , even the scientists had completed the AIDS not was a ruling fatal , the years down the line survival the quality of depend on of the of about the total immune system have all the patients to initiate the diagnosis , with best expectation for those who are not users of drugs : to 30 years in we have our 200 CD4 and 50 years , when our 500 CD4 .
At the words simple , what previous mean who a penny the diagnosis we have our HIV positive in 25 years of , under these terms &quot; on was done keep at the control will live a problems the 75 years &quot; , he the interviewed .
For better this , be justified should the in living the Mexican today is 76 years at the average .
If the death has down significantly in recent years , for Mexico , of who dying of AIDS bowed 6.678 in 2007 is now 4.862 at the 2011 ( annual we have our UNAIDS ) , is also true that appearance and of the AIDS , 60 there is a cent in from the data national have died .
In alone 255 people died at the 2011 , and are 187 fatalities until May of this year ; it is there universal access in drugs opportunistic since 2005 .
- why do still they fatalities ?
- to me to the problem is not for treatment .
This , so has happened in our hospital .
At least in the last 12 years not to we have our medicine the problem is that all the patients on coming very advanced because not their state infection , at the stages late the disease .
Took a fact overwhelming : &quot; many of ten in patient on coming when have now inherently is patently infection instrumental to what is to greater impact on the death global , is verdicts more and , is thus the , are must will provide proof of detection in mass , is now all to what overnight &quot; .
In your motion for line and specialists officials of the Council State this AIDS (  ) , also patients themselves , as , who out to the test a laboratory particular , only reasoned it had in a friend and , despite its short age , already in stage of AIDS and even , a by cancerous that is one of the complications common .
Everything changing when know you AIDS .
Some think are going to die and do not want to hear nothing .
&quot; if have now i will end now die , best i three times week and &quot; , say no in my case .
The movement in was for , i food well , I exercise , i products .
To date , their only know that cancer .
Alive a normal life , as who knows .
&quot; work , I have many activities , I , i have of sexual active , but complicity , i me who had their of the person &quot; ,  , who accepted share your privacy with Millennium for better motivate with his that to today , the is World AIDS , are afraid .
It ! the test , if had risk , we must between more early know are HIV positive , is better and if have the diagnosis , we must learn can really have live as any person , remains responsible .
This , comment , sums the slogan of that battle about the total AIDS this 2012 .
Condoms of counter
Large are the missed that there the we health and the citizen common , affirmed Regil Salazar , journalist who has taken the cause is HIV .
And the greatest is prevention .
The places dedicated to task &quot; effectively the been stepped the we have our condoms , before we by made by one or two , we on contraband the hundred , and this is very well but a there those who today , still , have no access a prostitute &quot; , told .
The most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents .

Nor is paying look forward and the , as did Governor González , about the total him if would the apportionment we have our condom in your government .
&quot; so is not the sexuality , the is closer even the condoms to have now profess of sexual &quot; , pointed .
He at the
