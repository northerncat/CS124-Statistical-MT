a strategy humble for hinder the for of fawn
the leaders Republican justify their policy the need of fight against the fraud electoral .
now well , the centre fawn as this last a myth and says that the fraud electoral is least often in the States United that the number of people that die to cause of the fall of a glimmer .
of fact , the lawyers Republican not have found more that 300 cases of fraud electoral in the States United in ten years .
a thing is certain : these new provisions will adversely to the rate of participation .
in that sense , these measures fawn in part the system democratic American .
the contrary of what that happens in Canada , the States Americans are responsible of the organisation of the elections federal in the States United .
and in that same line a majority of the governments Americans instance , to from of 2009 , new laws that cancelled the process of for or of vote .
this phenomenon has widespread after the elections of November of 2010 , that were the increase of 675 new representatives Republican in 26 States .
in result , for the year 2011 introduced 180 projects of law that assembly the exercise the right of vote in 41 States .
the new laws election are that the electorate be a document of identity with a was , also of a test of citizenship American .
other part , these laws reduced the periods of vote which , fawn the right to enrol as Forrester in the day the polling and couple their right the vote to the citizens with background criminal .
before of the elections of 2006 , no state American requirements that the electorate fawn a document of identity with was .
the state of fawn was the first in demand .
the Court Supreme of the States United this in 2008 the being of the law of fawn .
this , the authorities fawn quick to extend that practice to other States .
in the last years these authorities have supported projects of law in 34 States for force to the electorate to it a document of identity with was .
is important have in account that , the contrary of what that is in Quebec , the citizens Americans not have of a document of identity universal , as the card of the security social .
of fact , a 11 % of the citizens Americans , is say , 21 million of people in age of vote , not have with no document of identity with was we a agency government of their state .
another on , five million of new electorate in 2012 are of a document of identity with these characteristics .
but , to often , the obtaining the document of identity delays costs more of hundred dollars .
with what which , the new restrictions affect of way much to the young , the minorities and the people with income Netherlands .
in effect , a 25 % of fawn , a 15 % of people that earn least of 35.000 dollars the year , a 18 % of the citizens of more of 65 years and a 20 % of the electorate of between 18 and 29 years not have with a document of identity with was .
and still there more .
in many States the students , the electorate that more vote to the candidates democrats , not can use the document of identity with was we their institution .
other part , these ourselves States authorise to the Member of the clubs of fishing or of hunting that usually vote to the parties Republican to use the documents worldwide these clubs .
before of 2004 no state requirements the test of citizenship for vote .
coldest was the first state in it this demand .
since 2011 , a dozen of States has adopted laws that are that the electorate prove that are citizens Americans .
these measures for , clearly , limit the vote fawn .
seems be that two of every three electorate fawn support the party democrat .
another on , the legislators Republican supported in 2011 certain laws that fawn the for of electorate the same day the polling in eight States .
also , constrained the right of the people and the groups to create a service of aid to the electorate that is enrol .
these restrictions have consequences .
example , in the elections general of 2004 , the campaigns of for of the electorate contributed the registration of around of 10 million of citizens .
the measures taken since 2009 started that the rate of for of new electorate out in 2010 in compared with the year 2006 .
also , the legislators Republican adopted laws in other five States that shock the reduction the period of vote advance .
example , in the elections of 2008 in Florida , a 33 % of the electorate that voted advance were fawn , while that these last not represented more that a 13 % of the electorate the state .
in the case of the fawn happening exactly what same .
these not represent more that a 11 % of the electorate , what that is to a 24 % of the citizens that vote advance .
however , the white , that represent a 76 % the electorate , not represent more that the 46 % of the citizens that vote advance .
course , the legislators democrats and their supporters have theories desire to the adoption of laws that party the registration of electorate .
in this sense , the governors democrats have blocked several projects of law .
the Ministry tax of the States United intervened for decision the laws more controversial .
could , in part , limit the damage .
example , so only 16 of 34 States adopted the law that requirements the presentation of a document of identity with was .
however , is undeniable that the new rules taken fawn the exercise the right to vote in 2012 .
the critical democrats it the nature partisan of the laws that have voted , already that is clear that with them to influence in the results of 2012 in the States key .
a report the centre fawn of 2011 shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes necessary in the school electoral for achieve the Presidency .
is too soon for that with certainty if these amendments legislative to at of system electoral will a impact significant in the results of the elections presidential of 2012 .
a thing is certain : these new provisions will adversely to the rate of participation .
in this sense , the measures fawn in part the system democratic American .
detection the cancer of prostate : done the test or not apprising ?
in effect , the test of PSA is , in times , results erroneous , with counterfeit results negative or even counterfeit results positive , after the that decided to speeches medical so .
is a reason more that enough for to doubt to the men , already fawn of , on if should done or not the tests of detection .
done the test or not ?
we asked Council to two specialists .
in the studies by in the States United was a great rate of as between the groups of shows , what that is difficult interpret these data and to recommendations firm .
their part , the study European was certain difference of mortality between the patients that had done the detection and the that not .
the study , with a monitoring to the 12 years , proved also that there between the 30 and the 40 % of for of chronically assessment if not has done the test of detection .
recommend , therefore , the test to from of the 50 years , or to from of the 40 years if your father has suffered cancer of prostate .
the men of origin fawn have a rate of risk more high .
the key is take a good decision a time been the cancer .
there cancers aggressive and other cancers that are fawn .
is truly necessary achieve that the patient understood the degree of risk of their cancer . you must offer all the options possible and not necessarily try the cancers of prostate that not cases against the life to long term , in whose case must has more well a surveillance active of the disease .
today in day many men to the that them has been a cancer not are treaties , since that said cancer not is aggressive not one a risk for their life .
in their place , them we a surveillance active of the disease and , if this onus , them we a treatment .
fawn every time with more often criteria precise for decide who should or not be Treaty .
recommend that do the test in any case .
but is important that about with their doctor for determine if must done the test or not .
fawn has created , in collaboration with the society international of fawn , a tool that allows assess the pros and the pros the test of PSA .

prevent the fawn
unfortunately , not there a recipe miracle for prevent the cancer .
to despite of the progress of the research , the adoption of habits of life made are being the better way of reduce the risks of have the disease .
believe that if all the world fawn well and certainly what enough , could prevent a 30 % of the cancers .
&quot; if nobody smoke , that rate rise , the least , the 50 % &quot; , underlines fawn Beaulieu , spokesman of the society Canadian against the cancer .
in change , fawn that around the 10 % of the cancers are as .
many other are being completely explainable .
for the society Canadian against the cancer , the fight against the smoking still being a priority to despite of the in the number of smokers .
the tobacco is with with the 85 % of the cases the cancer of lung .
is , also , a factor of risk for other types of cancers .
it us the health of the people .
&quot; today today , still there 1,5 million of smokers in Quebec &quot; , declared the spokesman fawn Beaulieu .
a fact hopeful : 10 years after of to of smoking , the risk of die of cancer reduces to the half .
the fawn
the fawn and the obesity by also the emergence of the disease , according the fawn .

the fawn
in the last years , several scientists have examined the links between the complex correctly and the cancer .
however , the time their research not are bombing .
fawn the fawn , the studies about of the osteoporosis and are contradictory .
while that in one of them discovered a in of the risks of cancer of prostate , in another what that observed was , more well , a increase .
the effect of the osteoporosis D in the cancer not has been determine with clarity .
other part , M. Beaulieu should in the importance of about on the concerns and the background family of every one with their doctor .
&quot; to the test of detection not from cancer . &quot;
the fawn of fawn in fawn
the announcement the likely discovery the fawn of fawn resounding a great shock the summer last , and with reason .
believes , in effect , that this fawn is involve the mechanism responsible of the mass of all what that there in the universe , nothing more and nothing least .
and what that is more , is of the fawn whose existence Potsdam the model standard : our better or &quot; least bad &quot; explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the on , that still not has been seen financially .
but for the physical not is completely clear that involved of fawn .
we place to doubt that there a new fawn and that seems a the fawn of fawn predicted the model standard .
also , new data fawn this week in a important Congress of physical fact in Kyoto seem confirm that what is , although still more data for be completely insurance .
of all ways , we that is of fawn , already that the for of get seem few . will of what is .
there , in this great world , a law widespread and vital that means that two things not can is in the same place the same time .
not there way of infringing that rule and not what trying too , because will lieutenant damage .
although the physical of the particles be a world very complex , has shown that also in she there a law of these characteristics : the principle of exclusion of fawn , that stipulates that two particles not can should the same space the same time if are in the same &quot; state fawn &quot; ; a &quot; state &quot; that certain , unity way , of some of their characteristics .
the physical classify the particles in two categories .
a part we we with the good citizens called fawn , that supporting wisely the principle of fawn .
and other are the fawn , a laundry buffoons of fawn that not has respect nothing , or the least not this principle , what that means that can is in the same place and the same time .
according the indeed website the fawn fawn of the laboratories fawn that , true , is extraordinary , the fawn into in two groups : the landlords , of the that not we here , and the &quot; particles of force &quot; , the that the large forces of the nature spreading and with the which the fawn of fawn would of any way fawn .
these fawn , be stress here , not are the fawn fawn that we believe .
of fact , if by read this of , is thank to a fawn extremely trivial : the fawn or the &quot; fawn of light &quot; that it as &quot; bringing &quot; of the force electromagnetic .
in effect , when a fawn with a burden we accelerates or time of direction , &quot; fawn &quot; the field fawn in that be environment ; a little as when we a stone to a hole .
in this &quot; at &quot; stems a wavelength electromagnetic ( of the light , of the infrared , of the laser , etc. ) , and this wavelength not is other thing that a fawn ; is say , one of the fawn &quot; carrying of force &quot; .
field more fawn
happens what same with the fawn of fawn , with the difference of that is of another field , the field of fawn , that needs be &quot; fawn &quot; for that this fawn hang .
now well , the field of fawn is great more stable that the field fawn . for fawn ago lack to to energy extremely higher , a little as if like of a hole sobering in the that so only a rock fawn could avoid the surface .
this ago lack a in put of particles as the of the CERN ( ! the great fawn of fawn is a ring of 27 km of circumference ! ) for achieve such levels of energy .
the analogy with the field fawn is a new tool that it the relationship between the fawn and the mass .
of fact , not all the particles not all the materials Royal with the field fawn .
some , as the eradicate , what do , but other not : a paper of role , example , not will never same politician to the door of a freezing .
and of the same way , not all the particles Royal with the field of fawn : the that what do have a mass , while that the rest ( how the fawn , true ) , not the have .
now well , what &quot; can to &quot; all these research ? , question the madam fawn .
for the science , this it for verify the validity the model standard ( fawn ) , and allows , also , that the physical fawn the differences between the comments and the predictions the fawn .
their part , many want desire that are , therefore the will difference could open a door to a &quot; new physical &quot; that fawn certain holes the model .
this , there that say , has still enormous shortcomings , as that not proposes explanation any on to the serious ( ! fawn ! ) or to the on whites , that constitutes around the 80 % of the on the universe ( ! another fawn ! ) .
but not we found such differences in the CERN to the time .
fawn
the impact of these research in our day to day are difficult of predict , but not we that we let the say that not will no .
for that Just : to at of the years 60 , the pioneers the infrared in the laboratories not fawn in no the revolution that their jobs fawn .
fawn the applications scientific , but nothing more .
of fact , as already said the physical fawn fawn , that worked in the laboratories fawn , where invented the infrared in 1960 , and that produced the first infrared continuous ( the first were fawn ) in 1962 , the principle the infrared was more well have a &quot; would of laboratory &quot; .
imagine ...
and also , the applications can also to of whole the implementing that are to the research .
example , the same fawn fawn produced a fawn of light in 1969 in the course of their research in on of angles .
to despite of that not was in no their intention original , this fawn it now of &quot; eye &quot; for all the equipment digital the world , what that you thereby the Peace of physical in 2009 .
that not to say , course , that the activities the fawn want necessarily into our lives , but that never know ...
care palliative . the better way of die ... &#124; you fawn
in their Commission die in dignity , Quebec Indian recently the sensitive question the end of the life .
the debate must joined soon while for a project of law .
now well , within of that dominance essential , still there a that to .
you fawn has tried it of close .
ago hardly a weeks , the Sr. L. living only in their flat of the fawn .
the cancer of prostate that you was destroying you had given a space of two years .
&quot; I had given five years of life , but already have so seven &quot; , tracing , fact a is , fawn in their bed in the centre of care palliative Victor-Gadbois of fawn , to the that came the day previous .
&quot; but always is a shock , not we be prepared for this &quot; , continues .
the disease you has caused havoc : a weakness huge that you from go only the one and even feed only .
at with to a fawn lunch , on resigned that you help to feed .
purposeful , a even to he , to about with the issue that you play attention , you bring medicines and you offered a one .
the courage of the death ordinary .
&quot; my greater wish is that I fawn the parasitic , is humiliating &quot; , admits .
a hours more later , the team found no to that .
&quot; in the course of our lives projects that a man ago fawn of ordinary &quot; , tracing pierre fawn , psychologist in the centre Victor-Gadbois .
return to their childhood , for certain people , is a humiliation unacceptable .
&quot; that on of the capacity of the person for accept that regression &quot; , complaints .
because , according the opinion of the majority of the people that working in care palliative , the large at have place in the heart same of that regression .
all the patients that entering in the centre of care palliative Victor-Gadbois have cancer .
have a prognosis of life maximum of three months .
in that state , the team of doctors and nurses that them around already not offered the care &quot; curative &quot; .
the greater fear of the Sra. A. , of 89 years , is die &quot; aware and fawn &quot; .
but the disease you has fact be to their children .
&quot; have a good children &quot; , adds .
&quot; already not I are more wishes in this life &quot; , says , before of accept that you long a fawn for overcoming to breathe .
and expected , in the next days , a last visit of their son that lives in Italy .
in Victor-Gadbois offers , with a group of voluntary , the care the body and aid to the food .
are care palliative that them are when not can to nothing more .
for help to that their death be more fawn .
in Quebec we with a bed of care palliative for every 11.700 inhabitants .
is very little , already that we that all will die some day .
here , the life continues in the best conditions possible , it the Dra. fawn fawn , a of the male the centre .
already be to level of comfort physical , emotional or spiritual .
the fawn you offered fawn of their with brandy or fawn , according the demand .
to the diabetics already not them controls their rate of sugar .
the death way part of what everyday .
yesterday the night you uses a beer the Sr. X , that died in the course of the night .
this morning , their son end the beer to the feet the Patriarch .
&quot; about therefore to the patients as to their beings loved &quot; , tracing aged fawn , there of the care .
in the centre Victor-Gadbois the days discussions be never equal .
the on of a man of 94 years that fawn their last meeting family in the yard , well was between their fawn while all they to their health , a young of 36 years dies of way tragic , surrounded their parents , their woman and their two children , after have tried all for survive .
&quot; since ago six months , always there of three to five caged top people age of 45 years that of cancer &quot; , concerned the Dra. fawn fawn .
a 53 % of the patients that are admitted in the centre Victor-Gadboisarrivent next of their home and a 47 % the hospital .
problem the access to care fawn
a 77 % of the Canadians simply not has access to the care palliative , is say , to the care some for alleviate the suffering when a ill a to the stage terminal of their life , be in their home , in the hospital or in a centre of care .
and several bodies , as the centre Victor-Gadbois and the society of care palliative to home the Cardiff fawn , fawn almost exclusively in the care of the patients with cancer .
is precisely that great we on in the care health of Quebec what that ago that many doctors mentions in care palliative fear the adoption of a law that noise the euthanasia and the suicide for .
since the month of October , a clear signed fawn of the care palliative , as the Dr. Balfour fawn and the Dr. Shaw fawn , everything for demonstrate their opposition to such initiative .
according the Dra. fawn fawn , the system health of Quebec not is what enough responsible as for ensure that who have right to care palliative of quality before of that accept to with the euthanasia .
&quot; recently &quot; , tracing , &quot; I seen to a patient to 14 days in topical suffering large other that has fact what necessary for relieve .
fear that the patients who die only because not receive the care produce &quot; .
and parallel , many fawn fawn with their patients to the last day , to despite of the worst prospects .
the hopes of survival of Hélène Richard were already under minimum when he a treatment of offered exhausting .
&quot; when you I to my fawn that wanted stop the treatment , she I said that you was very it that like to of fight &quot; , tracing .
&quot; however , ! she I had said that not had nothing more that to ! &quot;
not there care fawn
the Dra. fawn believes that a 90 % of the people that considerably die grateful to their carers that not them have with in their demands a time them has relieved their pain thank to a team of care palliative .
but there that say that the care palliative not are absolutely fawn in what that as the treatment the pain .
according fawn fawn , there of the care palliative to home of Cardiff fawn , the patients not they to the treatments against the pain in a 8 % of the cases .
the end of the life , the doctors usually resort to the sedating shown , that it for ball the patient to the time of their haemorrhaging , already be of way sporadically or of way permanent .
not we pretend that not we that part the suffering .
every time more , the disease not reassured is to have the possibility of have that sedating shown .
the people that not are fawn say all what same : &quot; I i die &quot; .
but that not to say necessarily &quot; i the euthanasia &quot; , but &quot; i that I fawn &quot; .
the realisation of this exploit has been possible thank to a scholarships of journalism of the institutes of research of health of Canada .
fawn housing of great as in fawn
officials of the network road , employers the fawn , despised of funds of parties political and specialists of the mafia Italian have , day after day , what that know of a exclusively &quot; system &quot; , the that are part the industry of the construction , officials , political , unionists and landing .
a &quot; industry &quot; that went too expensive to the taxpayers Quebec , on all in the years 1990 and 2000 .
&quot; is how the system fawn a time we manager to the large media &quot; , fawn Delors fawn , Member in Quebec and former head of the police of Montreal .
he fawn the outbreak the scandal in 2011 , that was possible thank to a research to Fund on the governance compounded to contracts of roads in Quebec , that the first Minister liberal of that time , Jean fawn , not had deceased more that in delay .
the &quot; report fawn &quot; set a link direct between the industry , the funding illegal of the parties and the corruption between officials .
&quot; since the start of the research in 2010 , so only the Ministry of transport would saved billion million of dollars in contracts &quot; , analysing some of their prompts of stay with a part proportional .
the Commission fawn &quot; already has fact we to two mayors &quot; , adds , while expected power to to &quot; demonstrate the manner existing behind of the individuals &quot; .
a unit permanent corruption , created in 2011
the unit permanent corruption , created in 2011 , applies also with their team of controllers , researchers and analysts the government .
this unit works also of the police of &quot; the drawn fawn &quot; , that , since 2009 , have fact that the &quot; cartel the undue &quot; of Montreal fawn to the time of inflating contracts .
these last weeks , the unit has allowed the registration in series of the accusations fraud and corruption against charges municipal as Frank fawn and Richard fawn , Mayor of a city of the stopped .
the next of the list would Savary fawn , that has of resign of their since of Mayor of Laval , third city of Quebec .
suspicion that has fawn primarily bribery to change of contracts public .
has accused formally to engineers of the network road of Montreal and to employers of origin Italian , as Tony fawn and flax fawn .
this last has caused shock the explain to the Commission the mechanics the &quot; system &quot; of obtaining of contracts public .
he same paid for three years a 3 % the value of the contracts and in Montreal to a broker concerned to the mafia that fawn the money to dimension fawn , the party the Mayor fawn fawn .
M. fawn fawn money to are and are for the years 2000 , granting more of 88.000 dollars Canadians ( a 68.000 EUR ) to parties provincial , on all to the Liberals in the power .
buried , also , have organised a laptops of funds illegal for the ex-viceprimera Minister liberal , aged fawn .
the inflation the cost of the contracts of fawn
in Montreal , the &quot; system &quot; of corruption did with effectively .
Savary fawn , fawn of works public , what he perfectly to the Commission : in ten years received those , inviting to travel , fawn of golf , restaurants , parties of Hockey and bribery of companies the sector of the construction a total of 736.000 dollars , all this to change of contracts of undue whose costs much .
other officials of the network road have admitted that received money inflating the bills between a 30 % and a 40 % in concept of counterfeit extra .
also , a whoever the party the Mayor , Martin fawn , was to M. fawn of have fact the view blind deliberately to a budget parallel and country their coffers of money dirty .
to as of these revelations , M. fawn resigned to principles of November and was to Montreal to a crisis huge .
fawn fawn was a of the first policies ourselves of Montreal that was sound the alarm .
as unable the district of Rivière-des-Prairies , in the this of the island , opposed since 2010 to the sale of a ground municipal distinct 5 million of dollars and fawn 1,6 million to the promoters in plenary boom estate .
the 70 % the money of the campaigns election was money fawn
of the research that finally will to out , she will that rejected &quot; of a balance for power understand the functioning the system , fawn fawn , for stop the fawn and fishing to the guilty &quot; .
and adds that the process is &quot; painful , but positive &quot; .
we their the injured but would lack a unit of research clean in Montreal and be very vigilant for that the practices dubious not not .
how to the tidying .
regularly .
Delors fawn , their part , states that &quot; the officials have stolen hundreds of million of dollars &quot; , but is fawn on all the role of the &apos; &quot; political elected the aware of the thus &quot; .
fawn in a 70 % the proportion of money dirty that on to the funding of campaigns election in Quebec , fawn : &quot; I have said that that not is more that a for a of the reality &quot; .
the government fawn proposes limit to 100 dollars the donations to parties , but that not will the donation , according he , &quot; while not speaking strictly the expenditure election , will money dirty in the policy &quot; .
wrong a review full the system of fair of contracts public and of funding of the parties : &quot; not we we more under ; go the Fund of the things , with courage , we will rebuild the home with a foundation more solid , with more controls and laws &quot; .
if this history summit the image international of Quebec and of Montreal , M. fawn invited to those that smugglers to take the mirror .
&quot; ! the fawn not is the shout Barcelona ! &quot;
this season has distinct a new entity with the fawn .
how outbursts that progress ?
could explain a the of awareness individual , but also the new dimension the fawn .
have come large players .
fawn of day in day to their on .
the personal technical also I has has a .
and these elements I same to on to raise the level of my at .
in a party , that is more easy .
all is very quickly in the football .
but I not I fawn .
since my at in the centre of fawn of fawn fawn to my step Saint-Etienne , always I progress to steps bounds .
is to obtain benefit of the competition fawn Carlo fawn .
the recruitment of this summer are used to also parties of very high level .
know that every experience is crucial .
that ago that a player as I have wish of fight and take all .
other part , Carlo fawn I provided a in as to my enabled .
is supported deputy as claude fawn , that fawn in the same position that I .
fawn is the man that needed the team ?
course .
fawn have respect to all the technical .
today today , not there nobody as in the League 1 and is between the best fawn European .
has a great experience and has cattle many titles with the best clubs .
has worked with large players .
i that will other titles in Paris .
in January had a conversation very comforting with he .
I had of out of a series of injury .
the confidence that has in me it also my good performance .
what think on the fawn in the first part of the season ?
in the League 1 , Lyon we has taken the since of leader .
but we in the ambush .
one of our over objectives is the League of champions : we we mainly for the fawn of end with lifestyle .
what is the aim the club in this competition ?
we to try of to what more far possible .
to from of now , can to any thing .
but we a that say with to many and very good equipment European .
we , for start , end the first of our League with the Oporto for power receive the back of fawn of end .
the fawn can become in a great club European to short term ?
already has the budget ...
for become in a great club European , Paris has that earn titles and be there to long term .
today today , that not is the case .
to level economic , the fawn is given to their media for that that project never .
not earn the World in the League 1 , as in the last season , would a great failure ?
course , would a great disappointment .
this year we to invest all our efforts in us that title of champions .
in the last season not we far .
in May we have a disappointment , already that had with the conditions privileged for I first .
had a season strong .
coal with 79 points .
normally , with 79 points should have been champions ...
but another team , the fawn , had a season quite better .
this year i that will the good .
even if the large equipment as the Marseille , the Lyon and the Bordeaux fighting the title , i that we with the weapons for fawn .
believes that the media expect more the fawn ?
is normal that be a of us if we in what that has made in the players that we .
what we accepted completely .
after of that fawn 4-0 in home to fawn , that still are with things that absence is a little frustrating .
we ask what more expected the people .
never we earn 4-0 all the for of week .
! not we the shout Barcelona fawn
we of to in a project of at .
a team build with time .
in the League of champions we shown that we to and be present .
! look the Manchester holder that , after two argument , not has achieved into for fawn of end , and them also have made great fawn
in view of the sums alas , you fawn with 15 points of advantage to the working .
that would neglect to our adversaries and the championship of France .
Lyon and Marseille , that not were well the season previous , have seen &quot; powered &quot; this new fawn .
that shows that the League 1 is prevent .
hope that in May we say with a lived that , to despite of all the difficulties , we over fawn the prize .
the fawn seems completely dependent of the successes of you you .
better that say that we a &quot; fawn &quot; .
that to say that you is very responsible and that bottom many goals .
has come for demonstrate that is the star of the League 1 .
and has shown in all the equipment the that has last that is a great player , a star World .
in the group we the man and the player .
and he also respects to the men that has to their around .
what that has fact is truly exceptional .
that to to the others to increase their level of at .
fawn Silva , one of the best defenders the world , allows also that all move .
how Olivier through the football 2012 with the team of France ?
has been a disappointment .
was very himself participate in this football .
unfortunately , my injury I was earned time of at .
I things there and I reinforced .
today achievement playing good parties in the selection .
is what that than since my baptism with the &quot; showed &quot; .
learn the lesson of what that happened in Ukraine and to this must that today we a behaviour exemplary .
what vision you the first month of fawn fawn the with of the &quot; showed &quot; ?
is moving results .
are well located in the group of classification for the World .
the fawn is stringent , have to the players and have to earn .
as was the case of Laurent disagree .
but not i to comparisons .
disagree in their aim of fawn for the football .
hope that fawn fawn carried to the selection to Brazil .
the score ( 1-1 ) the 16 of October in Spain was for lay the foundation ?
that at we was confidence .
every one fawn all .
before of that shock in Spain , not had through a at be in whole my career .
with fawn , pay and sell fawn
all what contrary to the exchanges monetary current , based in the banks central , the transactions hidden and the burdens of prosecution between the parties .
also , as to often happens in the technologies , the vision policy is talking : the conviction of that the system monetary current , up of monopolies banking , has to the crisis financial .
of fact , fawn , invented fawn fawn ( a fawn ) , is to the time a currency virtual converted to dollars , EUR , etc. and a Protocol of change sure to the way of fawn , that allows the exchange of file of as to as .
have reported close of 200.000 transactions thank to 15.000 computers of the network .
and close of a billion websites website accepted the fawn as donations or as way of payment .
the prices the fawn , after have come to the top of 30 dollars ( 23 EUR ) in June of 2011 , fell to 2 dollars five months more later , before of again today to haunt the ten dollars ( the contributions fawn in the indeed bitcoincharts.com ) .
not is nothing impressive if what compared with the changes world in currency real or in products financial .
however , the Bank Central European ( ECB ) was he in a report on the coins lot published in October .
in he , described the fawn as &quot; the currency virtual with more success &quot; , &quot; that competing with the dollar or the euro &quot; and &quot; similar to the coins conventional &quot; .
fawn difference of other systems with types of coins lot as the &quot; appropriations &quot; , used for move in a fawn and that can earn playing or can buy ( and even in times fawn ) .
the network social Facebook developed also this kind of system .
but in all exchange a authority Central controls and is the changes .
with the fawn , all the nodes of network are to the time trustees of books of accounting , verifiers , interim of currency and buyers and sellers .
how works that network ?
every compromise between two users ago in reality between two directions electronic in way of email electronic .
a user can choose a direction different for every payment , thus so the deeds .
a whole of information compounded to this compromise signing electronically to through of a system of have to double key .
the network can so verify the authenticity of the compromise .
thank the content the file , is also possible ensure that the changes of fawn will in the book of accounts public , that you whole the network .
the milestone key is in write that new compromise in that book .
this is the resolution of a challenge have it to the computers and the winner , a kind of banker Central provisional , will the privileged of add that line supplementary .
is of a stage of fawn of file , is say , of transformation of a great file in a left numerical more short and only .
the computers &quot; you &quot; the new compromise and in a number before of &quot; fawn &quot; the whole .
the aim is find the number that will a left particular ( more zeros the principle ) .
a time that is that number , the other nodes fawn easily that is the good .
the compromise is then fawn people to the chain of joint of the other transactions ; whole change replaced the left .
if , for commit a fraud , a user like pay two sometimes with the same money very quickly ( in least of ten minutes ) , the network only accept as valid a of the two transactions ; the other would fawn , already that both have fingerprinting different .
the computer that opportunity the challenge has 50 fawn .
for avoid the inflation , that to into in two regularly , with likelihood before the end of 2012 .
the number of fawn in movement is , therefore , limited to 21 million , but are divisible to the fawn , what that is a for broader .
the difficulty of this challenge reveals also in every increase of the power of calculation .
the life of the network has already their downs .
the websites website that offered services for fawn have been attacked and have stolen fawn in by .
&quot; the failure used not affects the same Protocol &quot; , will pierre fawn , that has of launch fawn , a company of payment in currency real that used the network fawn .
the ECB has in account also the for of fawn of money thank to this service fundamentally .
but the money in effective is the same fault .
the players of weight as one reject the payments of this kind .
other , as the platform fawn , the accepted .
recently , Adi fawn and fawn rum , the fawn fawn in Israel , study the book of accounting and were that close the 80 % of fawn not everything .
in November were the &quot; cheap giants &quot; .
&quot; changed 30.000 dollars &quot; , fawn fawn fawn , that working for fawn , that becomes the fawn in gold .
pierre fawn , author of a book locked on that currency , believes quite in the potential of this technology also of in the network of transactions .
their system , fawn , is to a card of credit ( in currency real ) or to a payment mobile contact , but used fawn for validate the transactions , that so are more cheap .
the her , also , variety their identity and can , therefore , remain in the deeds .
the system is easy of to in in the shops , that not have that on new intermodal not fawn .
them enough with supply a direction that a telephone can &quot; fawn and recognise &quot; , precise pierre fawn , that will have thousands of users .
there a movement general of review of the systems professional systems more horizontal .
&quot; will lack a time for that fawn will , but in 2013 could have a change &quot; , fawn .
other part , in their report the ECB for event the risks various , today who higher , in case of that this currency have success .
we out of Afghanistan .
and after ?
the troops French abandoned their area of responsibility in Afghanistan ( fawn and fawn ) .

a constitution with fawn in fawn
is a new double or nothing the President rapid fawn .
while that Egypt is more divided that never in as to the statement Constitutional , that you make provisionally powers a , he decided playing the all the all .
by to all the world surprise the Wednesday , when announced that the House assembly would their text end the day next .
ago so only a week , the head of state had given two months more to this House for end their jobs .
and ago almost two years that Egypt used a text provisional , several sometimes amended , what that it the stability institutional and has to fawn judicial .
this new initiative not has fact more that increase the fractured in the country .
for their opponents , the President ethical in their &quot; grand fawn &quot; and continues &quot; betraying their word &quot; and &quot; trampling the right &quot; .
part of their supporters , will that is of a measure for end more quickly with the crisis institutional and policy and speed the process of transition .
in the next 15 days should organised a referendum .
a time of time very short that forced to the Muslim to up to their project of explain the text , Article Article , to the Egyptians .
for the President , is also of a way of to a being popular and democratic while the discussion cause havoc in all the country .
rapid fawn seems convinced of that the Egyptians will to their favour , as said in a interview the respectable American time .
at that that appeal has voted with very quickly , contains a an for the people Egyptian : &quot; or vote my text or i the powers a &quot; , powers that supposed that to their end with the adoption of the constitution .
is in that environment strange in the that 85 Member of this House assembly , Islamist in their great majority , voted the text yesterday .
the majority of the Liberals not out to the call .
to in of November , a little before of the statement Constitutional , had closed the door because considered that not could to assert their points of view .
the representatives of the rights human , the minorities religious and of the society civil did what same .
to end of that was the quorum necessary , yesterday the morning But to 11 people , Member substitutes , to whole haste .
some of them are very those to the Muslim Muslims .
as expected wait , the articles voted what have been unanimity .
to the commentators them ago grace , other part , the fact of that a of the few discrepancies of the working has expressed virtually to the time of the sentence , therefore is so that several Member the Committee came to think that the clock of the assembly was .
the text , that yesterday later was still being voted , certain of 234 articles .
the Article 2 , subject of all the expectations , still being finally same the of the constitution of 1971 , that stipulated that &quot; the principles of the Sharia are the source main the right &quot; .
the parties fawn , for who the establishment of the law Islamic is a vindication fundamental , were that so replace &quot; the principles &quot; &quot; the rules &quot; , what that would allowed a implementation more strict .
for the Islamists , that this Article not has been amended is a guarantee of their good will and of their respect towards the other components of the society Egyptian .
the Liberals what fawn of hypocrisy and they that not is more that of a arisen advertising .
according them , the Islam of the constitution ago to through of other articles .
are , in special , the Article 220 , that which to the University Al-Azhar a role advisory , in particular for all at that has of confirm their accordance with the laws of the Sharia .
according the specialist in Egypt Sophie fawn , is disturbing because &quot; the people call to upon not is elected and not has no legitimacy democratic .
here signs the premises of a theocracy &quot; .
the fears of the Liberals are also by the fact of that the next rector of this University would quite least moderate that the current .
&quot; now , not there a involvement religious concrete .
with this constitution we in the framework the state civil .
the majority of the lawyers that have working in that text not are intolerantly but it , some of them educated in the system French &quot; , it fawn fawn , that for a i on the transition Constitutional Egyptian .
but recognised that can have certain ambiguity in about the Article 220 , therefore the terms employees fawn the vocabulary religious .
&quot; we talking in particular the term fawn &#91; for Islamic , fawn &#93; .
and the question that could be in the future would in what measure are the judges civilians competent for upon above of all this &quot; .
more beyond of their nature religious , the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that are to the powers prize that which the President of the Republic .
the Muslim Muslims fawn that are few in compared with the that were for the previous regime .
another point contention : the powers charter the army .
with the wish of the military , the review the budget of defence not will subject the Parliament , but to a Council national of defence .
not will the from of civilians in courts military , as protestors the associations for the defence of the rights human .
these also were their concerns relating the text , that they was .
the crime of blasphemy in and , of now in forward , the insults are prohibited , what that could have serious consequences for the freedom of expression , on all the of the press .
also , no Article emphasises the protection of the women , underlines fawn fawn , of Rights Rights Watch .
according she , what only positive has been the ban of the torture of agreement with the Article 36 .
the word not one in the constitution previous .
although the President Egyptian should out yesterday the night in the television , out demonstrations for this at .

&quot; the large and powerful &quot; you will to Moscow : immigrants savers for the fawn
while Members and defenders of the rights human is on the consequences that bring the law on the examination compulsory , already have appeared in the country con that in with certified &quot; counterfeit &quot;
every year , 13 million of workers immigrants they to Moscow , St Petersburg and other cities of Russia .
in their majority are citizens of countries of Asia Central : Uzbekistan , Tajikistan and Turkmenistan .
their only aim is earn money for help to their families that have been in home .
since the 1 of December will in force a law , according the which every immigrant labour must to a examination for check their knowledge of the language Russian .
now , this rule is applies only for those that have the intention of work in the sector of provision of services , institutions of services Community , services domestic and trade the will .
however , with the time , as promise in the service Federal of immigration , the examinations will obligatory for all the immigrants .
also , not will enough with holding the examination of the language , if not also the of history Russian and the of foundations of the legislation .
the knowledge of the language must confirm even for receive and renew the permit of work .
are exception the citizens of the countries where the Russian is the language official .
not will subject to this law the people that started obtain their certified of education and qualifications before of the dissolution of the Union Soviet in 1991 .
usefulness , growing and defence of the fawn
the network of centres examiners will under the Institute of language Russian fawn , the University of the Friendship of the peoples , the University state of Moscow , the University state of St Petersburg and other institutions of education higher Russian .
the immigrants will stand to the evidence in all the cities , now same in Russia are open more of 160 centres of this kind .
the initiative on the introduction the examination was supported the Members of the Duma state and the service Federal of immigration .
but the defenders of the rights , a before of that the law by in force , started many sometimes to this question to the press : and what will this in reality ?
what changes bring the mandatory the knowledge of the language , therefore for the Russians as for the own immigrants ?
in first place , they the representatives the service of immigration , this will reduce the number of people that suffer &quot; slavery labour &quot; .
very people about today on the defence of the rights of the immigrants labour , it Emmanuele fawn , head of the representation the service Federal of immigration of Russia in Tajikistan .
the defence of their rights must shot before of their starting .
only a system of selection organised will resolve the problem of the workers immigrants in a 90 % of the cases .
the problems the have the immigrants profession , education , the that not know the language not spend the control doctor .
the understanding of the language , says fawn , the future immigrant be condemned to find people unscrupulous that , with the pretext of help , you Please a &quot; fawn paid &quot; to a caging and close fawn , where he and dozens of other as he consume for months food not documents , working of 12 to 14 hours the day .
we a explanations of complaints of our immigrants .
&quot; in their homeland them promise a thing , but the to are unaware , them deprived of their passports , not them paid the wages promised &quot; , confirms the head of the direction of immigration labour the service of immigration of Tajikistan , fawn Sharipov .
! not fawn , fawn fawn
however , while therefore many citizens of the republics of Asia Central that want work in Russia recognise that not only not know the language the country the that to go , but that also in their language own write with difficulty .
course , this not is therefore their fault but their own unfortunately : are few the Uyghurs , fawn , fawn that they be the luxury of receive education primary normal .
this must to that their families even not have nothing that to of feed to the children , not about already of fawn , fawn and fawn what necessary for the school .
the to to the adolescence , these boys lawfully to work to the first opportunity .
is difficult , if not know the language , recognise them .
&quot; one feel Ayr and than &quot; .
however , in what that as to the law on the language , the defenders of the rights quarters a point important .
the examinations will to out only for those immigrants whose status be legal .
if not have that status , not will not examination and , in result , no work official .
while therefore , the majority of the workers immigrants are living in Russia illegally .
&quot; welcome or ban the step to strangers &quot;
many visitors claim that receive the status official in our country not is so easy .
the cause is in the obstacles bureaucratic and in the difficulties of the language in .
also , the legalisation costs money : of twelve billion to sixteen billion fawn .
however , a for false can to quickly and only billion over fawn .
the employees of the police Russian know that generally have documents counterfeit , not we entered and officer the cases of extortion .
&quot; we they hundred or at fawn for cigarette or teaspoons &quot; , a to the journalists the citizen of Tajikistan , fawn fawn .
&quot; we , not do fawn , buying a paint &quot;
the first day of the entry in force of the law on the language , it of clear that not only the documents of registration of immigrants can be counterfeit .
several certified &quot; counterfeit &quot; of knowledge of the language already have been fake officials the service Federal of immigration .
the documents counterfeit had been printed in fawn standard of colour .
course , came to the hands of the new owners not as gift : every immigrant , fawn facilitate the task of to the evidence , paid the document seven billion fawn .
this is two sometimes and a more expensive that the procedure official of examination , that cost the worker immigrant three billion fawn .
the main task for a future next is protect the system against the corruption for that the &quot; qualifications &quot; not they buy , fawn the officials the government and the defenders of the rights .
to the time , the authorities can promised to the workers immigrants that not would been to with success the examination the first time more time for to the course basic of the language .
also , to the immigrants that not speak Russian them prepare jobs that not require communication active with the people .
the Ministry the internal not the measures down against the trade illegal of fawn

the Ministry the internal proposes apply the law with greater rigid in relationship to the owners of weapons of use civil .
this is the reaction the government to the recent incidents : fawn correctly for festivities of weddings in the that fortunately not there victims , and the massacre generated the lawyer disbanded Dimitri fawn , in the that fawn seven people lost the life .
the police to ban the use and the possession of weapons inhuman in places public and raise the age minimum for the obtaining of licence for fawn weapons , of 18 years to 21 years .
this idea was supported the summoned the Committee of the Duma in on of security and fight against the corruption , Irina fawn , who promised that the reforms in the law on the possession weapons will as to the Duma the state in a future next .
not all feel pleased with the fact of that the authorities Russian are trying of to this problem one the &quot; policy of hand hard &quot; .
in the network has appeared a letter open , whose authors , representatives of various organisations social of competitions , are that bear of such measures of &quot; fawn sense &quot; .

are in strike the employees of restaurants of food fast and supermarkets in EE.UU.
to a quarter part of adolescents Americans are their first jobs as cash in &quot; McDonald &apos; at &quot;
in the last days , in the States United has on a wave of protests against the Netherlands wages that paid in the supermarkets of the channels fawn and in restaurants of the popular chains of food fast , such as &quot; McDonald &apos; at &quot; , &quot; Burger King &quot; , &quot; fawn fawn &quot; , &quot; fawn &apos; at &quot; and &quot; fawn fawn fawn &quot; .
now nobody if to here if will or not this wave to the nine points , or if has aimed lose forces and fawn in their first stages .
the actions of protest have with the support of the unions and of a series of NGOs of left .
also the increase of the modest wages contemplate the workers of fawn and the the system of food fast , the aim of the organizers of the protests is the creation of unions of workers in these companies .
now , this sector of the economy virtually not has been occupied the movement trade .
forty and six cents the year ?
the actions started the week last , after the day of action of thank , the called &quot; Friday black &quot; . that day , in States United fawn the orgy of cheap that pelagics to million of inhabitants , and that to sometimes was accompanied of clashes .
that day , some workers of the channels fawn , that employs to 2,2 million of people in the world , abandoned their jobs of work and fawn guards of protest with to the unions and activists of left in the shops of the channels , whose products encounter to people of income modest and moderates .
fawn sold of all , since fawn , rifles of hunting and batteries for cars , to fawn , eggs and milk .
the products in their shops are of average between a 8 % and a 27 % more cheaper that the of the supermarkets more large .
is that that many workers paid of fawn buy only in the work .
the availability and the had of products have fact of fawn a of the corporations more large of America .
according the words two critical , fawn can afford the luxury of sell products to very under price , in part because paid little to their workers .
these last also complain of the poor conditions labour , such as the lack of fawn or naked of hand .
that &quot; Friday black &quot; the participants of the demonstration ruinous the increase of wages and complained of that the cost the sure of health provided the channels happened of 30 to 100 dollars month .
for a worker typical of fawn , that a 9,5 dollars time , this expenditure is excessive , said .
scientists of the University of California in fawn argue that if fawn is the wage a to 12 $ time , this you cost to the channels 3,2 billion of dollars .
this is approximately a 1,1 % more of what that spent in wages now .
if fawn put the increase wage in the shoulders of the consumers , every visit to the shop them will only 46 cents more expensive .
in a year them will the ridiculous amount of 12,39 dollars more of what that on now .
the supporters of fawn word satisfied that the protest had place so only in nine States and that not was no loss to the channels .
the &quot; Friday black &quot; prolonged in their shops since the 8 of the later the Thursday to the midnight the day next and , for that time , fawn miscalculations around of 5000 articles second .
in total , their boxes statements held the &quot; Friday black &quot; almost 100 million of transactions .
the representative of the company , are fawn , declared in a interview the website website of left fawn ex , that was their since of work &quot; least of five &quot; employees of fawn and that the protest not had been more that &quot; another trick of relations public &quot; , organised the union of workers .
&quot; ! box free ! &quot;
the protests continued this week in new York , in the that the objectives not were precisely the large stores fawn ( that in this progressive city not them have hold , and that now not there none ) , but the &quot; McDonald &apos; at &quot; and other restaurants cheaper .
! McDonald &apos; at says that sold thousands of million of pieces , and then not even you Volvo the low disease and not you paid your work honest fawn
fawn williams , Member the Council municipal of new fawn
currently , of agreement with the law Federal and the of new York , the wage minimum is of 7,25 $ time .
the restaurants of food fast what will increasing with the time , but only slightly , and of average , the workers ordinary receive in new York 8,90 dollars time .
nobody earns least that them in this city .
how is possible survive in new York with that money , for me is something incomprehensible .
there a time when almost the quarter part of the adolescents Americans experience the McDonald &apos; at and worked there , behind of the displayed , to time over after of the school , although still living with their parents .
few were the that his this as the main source of income or fawn stay there a time .
now , constantly fawn in some interviews with workers of McDonald &apos; at that complain of that have that live of this wage , and to sometimes even which to their children .
another on , in a forum of the magazine Wall the Street there a comment whose author out that is irresponsible have children if not know with what them of feed .
the participants in the protests , that started to the 6 : 30 of the morning the Thursday in the McDonald &apos; at of the 40th the and fawn fawn , ruinous that to the cash and broth of food fast them start to pay what least 15 $ time , or be , that them double their wage minimum current .
also ruinous that in the sector of the food fast believe unions of workers .
the law of the EE.UU. prohibits to the administration restrict this right and punish to the activists the movement trade with tricks and redundancies .
other part , rarely time the administration them facilitates the life .
but , reasons objective , is easy that the unions fawn the sector of food fawn .
a of the main is the excessive rotating the personal .
fawn
fawn protests had place that same day in other restaurants cheaper of Manhattan .
the culmination of the action had place to half the rally in the McDonald &apos; at it close of Times Square , in the that took several political democrats local , in particular the Member the Council municipal of the city fawn williams , that said : &quot; McDonald &apos; at says that is sold thousands of million of pieces , and then not even you a hospital not you paid your work honest &quot; .
the demonstrators received the support of other leading democrats of new York , example the candidate to Mayor of the city garage of fawn , that said that &quot; we support to the workers the sector of food fast for that forgetting receive wages fair and the prosperity economic that deserves every fawn &quot; .
as what described the newspaper chosen York Times , this has been the greater demonstration of this kind in the history American of the food fast .
but in she took only a few hundreds of people , even not all them were employees the service of food fast , in the that fawn tens of thousands of people of new York .
still not is clear if this will of lit for to a movement mass .
&quot; now , is the which not is so easy &quot;
the issue of the reality increase , so popular between the sports to the technologies modern , recently is with as mainly to through the prism of glasses special .
to beginning the summer , in their conference annual Google proved a model in movement and subsequently , in November , it that Microsoft had tabled also a request for ombudsman the attached patent .
however , of a conversation with the head the group of technology interactive 3D in the laboratory of Microsoft of Cambridge , fawn fawn , fawn that for the scientists of this company , the glasses already been to a stage last .
to them them attracts the perspective of the manipulation of items lot in the air with the hands naked and the creation of areas lot open .
- favour , in terms general , what is the subject of study of their group of research ?
- we we to the interaction persona-ordenador , but also we of further the limits of this interaction .
now the humanity in their great mass has been trapped in the stage of work with the fawn of the screen flat , to sometimes the it with the finger .
but us we look 5-10 years forward and intend the changes scattered in this interaction .
example , the video fawn and the sensors fawn represent a step forward and today in day no fawn sold fawn , already that to all them interested the control gestures .
- what more we be the future ?
- to despite of that fawn has taken the interaction the level physical , great part of this still happens in a screen flat , to sometimes in 3D .
the introduction of information has just ( the system a more data ) , and the exit still not is very good .
we trying of change this , we in systems of nigh truly fawn , based fawn fawn in different technologies , including the of design .
must release the world of the is the our , the physical , do more tangible .
for this , however , is necessary recognise not only the user , but also the space that what are .
then we complete the world real with items lot of a way more comfortable .
in first place , ! the considers with these thinks helmets of reality virtual fawn
- what think you on the control voice ?
a detail very popular , but not believes that what fawn ?
- clear that not you can be a panacea , is outstanding of resolve the question of privacy , already that not always to that the others through of our actions and intentions .
of fact , all the types of interaction with adequate are good , but every one in their own field .
example , for the control of equipment in places public , we a project in the that we in the gestures , but not in movements loose , but more short .
also , the gestures were every not the House the has , but a is that risen the movement of the bones and the truly .
now is very large , but in theory can be small the size of a clock of is .
but , in general , the future is for a kind combined of control , example of gesture R voice .
- how is that ?
- example , how I would you that you ask this ship of fawn ?
you shall and the bring the same time .
- normally I only i .
- oh , that is to be very difficult of recognise .
- or be , you to force to the users to adapt to what that can or not can to in this time the machine ?
- not necessarily , but is a rapprochement mutual .
i that in a future next we to have that work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that they determine with precision the reactions of the person .
these can be , example , sensors infrared , already that provide a good resolution in depth , what that is very important .
- if we of their work with the sensors of fawn fawn , what complaints has you of the chambers modern ?
them lack resolution , depth or something more ?
- in principle , the generation current is what that can be the start of our work with the recognition fawn .
course , would good obtain 8 fawn to the at of 1000 fawn .
but the question not is in the fawn , but in the quality of the parent and in the depth .
since this last point of view , all the technologies current not are what enough good for us ; this more work to the designers of fawn .
or be , that we that remember not only the resolution in the central X and and , but also in Z.
also is important the at , the number of tables second .
the movements human are quite dynamic and the current of 30 fawn are truly scarce , on all for the gestures .
fawn fawn , of our laboratory in fawn , was a rises of contact with fawn fawn of prosecution of 1 to 100 fawn and is mention that the modern sensors produced in series are more close the second value ( 60-100 ) .
not all the world understand in what measure this affects to the interaction hombre-máquina .
to me I would very useful for my work a equivalent of such has , but that not take contact for that the tables second are more .
- and not is necessary increase the number of chambers ?
- the fawn has now three &quot; chambers &quot; , a of the which is of fact the an of rays infrared and the second the recipient of the signal has .
but the third House is in reality a simple rises the fawn visible .
this not used for determine the depth the subject .
potentially , more amount of chambers could resolve the problem ...
or the contrary , increased and fundamental the amount required of are .
would good create a prove flexible of fawn , playing with the curvature of location of the chambers and see how this help to fawn the position fawn .
- what that I remember , Microsoft , to difference of Google , not has tabled their glasses the public .
not you seems that , since the point of view the use on of technologies of reality increase , the glasses are a of the platforms more we ?
- course , to all the pink quo in high a telephone intelligent in the hands , not is very comfortable , but I think : the better option would a reality increase &quot; fawn &quot; when , in basis of a platform of cloud , you could to of the glasses the telephone intelligent ,
the glasses are equipment very personal , in that is their force ( the things private only you will see ) , but also their weakness : a reality increase based in glasses not you will work on items lot with with other people .
- imagine a time that the manipulation of items fawn lot in the air is available not only for Tony fawn of the film &quot; fawn fawn &quot; , but also for any simple deadly .
there a problem in this idea that the critical usually out : ! not there answer fawn fawn
! the hands not feel nothing fawn
what answers for their group for this challenge ?
- in my conferences to often say that the reality increase is the seventh just in the interaction between the man and the machine .
i that the eighth well could be the addition of sensations fawn .
while therefore , one of the noticed more interesting is the use of the second hand in quality of aid for the image .
! with the you perfectly fawn
but there also technologies that are truly win to to fawn to these &quot; images in the air &quot; . example , the interference of several rays fawn targeted to a point specific where is the finger a that similar to the that one feel if someone as fawn in the fawn of the it , but that that still is very weak .
there also fawn for the jailer that on in the fawn fawn of the it , this also a direction promising .
- has Treaty of is the which ?
to think that he feel what that seems that should feel in the time in that is something ?
- that is a good idea , still not what we tried .
here behind another challenge with the that we that fight for a time , how to that a person physically within in a space very small creates that is to a space open , almost end . we working also in the idea of the we of to ( not as the of the rife ) , platforms mobile , so as the of the much giants .
now , is the which not is so easy , still there that work for many years .
that is what that ago attractive the work with the reality virtual for the researchers , that many things are in a state of total view .
will personal biased in place of culture - Rosbalt.ru
&quot; fawn &quot; continues the project &quot; fawn of St Petersburg &quot; , into to the citizens that are front , to the forefront the art and of the culture .
in this list of the best are it figures the art and the scene of St Petersburg , whose achievements they more beyond of the city : to often are recognition in Europe that Russia the man even .
the new hero of &quot; fawn &quot; is the fawn artist fawn Miller .
whole the city known to fawn Miller , a man fawn clothing of red of down from , the that can find close the Museum Russian , close the garden of summer or in meetings of fashionable and fawn .
the tables of fawn Miller always by to fawn , where wants that displayed .
fawn Miller is one of these fawn purely fawn of St Petersburg , are of new fawn .
fawn Miller is a brilliant representative the fawn of St Petersburg of end of the 80 - principles of the 90 .
also , is a man urban , whose emergence in the streets of the city meeting in the inhabitants grins and comments to all the state of mind .
recently , took in their hands a fawn and became in the fawn of St Petersburg , already that has grown for to so difficult role , their existence Bohemia , their philosophy and their image .
- fawn , what you the city clothing of red and not of yellow or fawn , example ?
- fawn the colour red because am leather of fashionable and I am to the about and to the image .
in this world , the colour red is a compromise between the artist , the are of images and the society .
although in the society , all what that not be a little grey for aggressiveness and extremely of properties nothing good .
but my simplified are in to that significant a conversation .
whole the history of my actions fawn are a invitation the debate .
- when fawn that fawn be artist ?
- in a statement the Palacio of culture fawn , where paraded my jobs .
I realised account of that that was my way .
then the wave of old artists not official had over , and the new , free as I , were still fawn .
I i friend of artists of the new wave , with the subsequent to the that from in Gaza and fawn , that was to &quot; Pushkinskaya-10 &quot; , and already over the new wave .
I fawn in the theatre the clothes , the music of all the up , but not the you .
- and all this fawn in your clinic of art ... - for me was important certainly in the centre cultural of St Petersburg , where be together the best minds creative .
in 1995 , previously a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there , while not had reforms , broad a club artistic musical , a club resort , the home of the Bohemia of St Petersburg .
many born there : fawn , fawn about , remember the way in that fawn brought the project to &quot; the eartag of will bold &quot; .
fawn and their friends fawn songs small under fawn , fawn trousers meagre , between them was the currently composer of fashionable Angelika fawn .
when the group started to play in live , became in &quot; fawn &quot; .
fawn was fawn of many programmes before of the times of Hali-galivskih .
them we to fawn and was the start of their great career ; the education basic and training the received of us .
gallery &quot; D 137 &quot; , the &quot; club fawn , are the remains of the clinic the art .
there would our employees and customers travelled .
am a hero the century last , when the culture mean something .
in the year 2000 , the survey was in the press , the Prize was &quot; the people of our city &quot; .
in the nomination &quot; artist the year &quot; i elected I , so end my culmination .
in these new times not is comfortable work ; I am a man the that you like the truth , the honesty and the culture the century last .
in our times is easy done popular , but the culture and the popularity will separate . one can be popular but very little seems .
- there in your jobs something recognisable .
- many of my paints are fawn , in them this clearly the today and the commonplace .
i to to a statement agenda , &quot; the Museum Russian in buffoons &quot; .
the buffoons are a category timeless .
I before was her , but now be so is painful and other .
but in the buffoons all fawn and the tragedy would .
I love what grotesque , have ideas grotesque .
example , the saved the world by a change totalitarian and compulsory of clothes .
now to one what are the clothes , fawn in what external , but not in the internal of the person .
and , such time to that person not you should not to the hand , but fawn in the face .
and the deception will when changes of clothes .
- ago little you we in the role of fawn urban . - a city fawn must have a hero so .
! who better that I for become fawn
- well but , to what better the art trade can be broth ?
- now the art trade must be careful , fresh , have you .
we being witnessing of the disintegration of the cultures .
before the people fawn in some , the fawn wanted a thing , the fawn other .
now all have divided in fawn , is difficult please to all .
not am a ticket of hundred dollars for like to all .
now there that think to who your favoured .
now , every hero of seems has their 100 fan .
- ! and for listen to fawn fawn they thousands fawn
- will to it the devotes , there works the sphere sexo-social .
and to a event cultural will 300 people , 10 billion never come . as result , least management , least money , all fawn .
have to my fan , what more important is not deceive , not to to lose what that Olivier achieved .
when was young was such tables that a fawn the fawn your in the wall the on of fawn and fawn .
I I with paints , with the that what general the people stops .
now to often who the concepts .
say culture spiritual , culture of consumption .
not there no culture in the consumption , that is other history .
I am a man of the culture of yesterday , fawn under the example of artists that living in the poverty and died in the poverty , obstruct the money only for paint tables .
I am to favour of this culture .
- fawn , what is what that you lack to St Petersburg ?
- good experts in culture .
there a concept : official of the culture .
but not all them can their to the culture .
when the on were the right all was of other way , the on such time not seaports very well the culture , but they that was necessary keep to the experts right .
in Moscow now there very good consultants .
we people in St Petersburg that well could be experts , but are closed , because need experts to a level higher that nevertheless that to they and them open way .
now is fawn the will personal biased .
what same fawn , but the difference is that them say honestly that not all the art modern is accepted , there some artists that have that to other museums .
- what is for you St Petersburg ?
- St Petersburg not is a capital cultural . in Moscow there very more culture , there there ground .
but on our stones is difficult that the art grow .
need ground cultural and we now more writers that readers , this is .
in Europe there a lot of people with curious that is to exhibitions and concerts .
in our case , this class is tiny .
we that to that the art is of fashionable , as what was to at the century last .
the project nabucco with a subsidy of St Petersburg .
to to light in the fawn
the land is in danger .
warming global or clash with a asteroid murderer .
tailbacks of vessels space with human to board proceed in for of a planet of spare .
for keep the humanity ago the question main : how continue the kind in conditions of cannot or in the same planet of spare ?
i that there little where choose .
of fact , only two are real planets that can be colonial , the least fawn .
&quot; these are Venus and Mars &quot; , says the scientists head the Institute astronomic state , fawn P.K. ( fawn ) , Vladimir fawn .
but if the conditions in Mars are best for the life , in the surface of Venus the temperature is of 500 degrees .
only can live to large fawn or in the about of Venus ... in the space .
started to address the problems of reproduction in the space with the flora .
ago already a century that were to out experiments with plants .
four generations of peas fawn in about not differed in nothing of the varieties outlaw .
after wine the rearing of insects in the about , small disposed of the fruit , the fawn .
in 1979 submitted the space eggs of fawn for check how develops the embryo in conditions of cannot .
helps as result a fawn normal .
but then start the problems .
&quot; the problem is in that this fawn has that find support , must in on their own feet and start to ! &quot; , it Vladimir fawn , the director the laboratory the Institute of problems fawn ( fawn ) of the Academy of sciences of Russia .
the not find support , the fawn by fawn the gambling .
and after of 10 hours in the would babies was a fawn total of the prompts .
the fawn not ECU to the light not the Audio .
and the unfortunately was that the out of four days simply died .
&quot; and two sometimes we that born the fawn , but then what stop because was impossible work there with them &quot; , , observing Vladimir fawn on failure the experiment with the fawn in the space .
the last time that a &quot; fawn &quot; biological did to the about was ago 16 years .
in the spring the 2013 foreseeable the experiments .
however , in the fawn &quot; fawn &quot; only travel species of a same sex .
there a experiment with asked , that were settlement the space already with foetuses .
in principle , not found nothing fawn .
&quot; this was precisely in the fawn , but this was a experiment only , and studies as this must be to out &quot; , observing Vladimir fawn .
after the landing , the asked space had offspring .
however , still not has managed address the problem of the reproduction directly in the space .
is a challenge difficult .
the animals , the lose their habitat her , simply not can to their your sexual .
the man , however , to difference of the small animals , in principle , can .
the fawn fawn has the reasoning abstract and is capable of create a Fund emotional appropriate .
experiments similar not have to out reasons ethical .
but the women travel the space since ago already 50 years .
the greater risk what happened fawn .
and what more precious that has the humanity is the Agency female .
our fawn flying , and nobody in the land could say : if is after of a flight the space .
will or not have a baby after of this flight .
&quot; after of all , to this question nobody has would &quot; , observing the off the sector aerospace fawn fawn .
in June of 1964 , only after of a year the flight the space , the first woman fawn , fawn fawn , was to light to a daughter .
the father of the girl , fawn fawn , was also fawn .
in 1988 , the second woman fawn , Svetlana fawn , who two sometimes was in about and even worked in the space open , had a son .
however , the risk there .
we few , are writing the astronauts to who after of long flights all them has result well , and a generation healthy next growing .
&quot; and if can say more , is dangerous even in flights fawn &quot; , sums the pilot fawn , hero of the Union Soviet , hero of Russia , fawn fawn .
however , the humanity must to some new to in the biotechnology , in the protection radiation , in the creation of the serious artificial .
the fawn the centre of preparation of fawn is a stage compulsory in the preparation for the flight .
in conditions of fawn would , the fawn profess their skills of work in the space .
the water fawn the cannot .
if for a adult the water is a environment comfortable , although still hostile , for a child would born is their element home .
the small hombres-anfibio seem confirm that the life in the land about the Ocean .
there a connection between the fact of that the baby even approximately 9 months within of their mother in the tanks fawn , therefore you will more easy used then the water .
in principle , this is logical , because since the time the birth to the time the first one spend only 2 weeks .
&quot; this is very little for forget something &quot; , says Marina fawn , fawn of swimming of would babies .
in short , if the cannot is a state more natural for a would born , for the women is necessary the fawn , the force of the serious .
in the cannot the truly fawn and of the fawn fawn very quickly , the capacity of expulsion the experiments reduces .
good , fawn that , by in the action of encouraging for the childbirth .
can , course , to to light in a House special , this what fawn .
&quot; and then what ? &quot; , fawn fawn ago this original question .
other part , the child also needs serious artificial .
the that of serious , the Agency not generated the skeleton not the system lymphoid .
to a would born in about is impossible fawn with a suit special for fawn , as to the adults .
simply you time of what that is vital for he .
&quot; and this experiment that we to to together , the allow the birth of a child in a environment strange , will place to that fawn to the land to a disabled , to a person completely suit &quot; , for the head the Committee of bioethics the Institute of problems fawn of the Academy of sciences of Russia , Angelika fawn .
now , the birth of children in the space is a question theoretical .
however , with the time this will a reality , when the beings human in their vessels reformed to a planet ago that will the home for their children babies in the space .
head of fawn : the inspection the system &quot; fawn &quot; not has given with the political fawn
in on of tenders public , the Republic Czech account with good inspectors and a legislation of quality , although their implementation fawn .
so what says Ransdorf fawn , of of the office of control by ( fawn ) in a interview for Aktuálně.cz.
&quot; the law never will perfect &quot; , but their implementation must be right . &quot; this is , in my opinion , what that we lack &quot; , so describes the situation current .
the controls joint of the inspectors Czech and Germans also they to conclusions similar .
as example of a practice wrong , mentions the attitude of fawn fawn towards the system of be be only on the role , that known as the system &quot; fawn &quot; .
the first Minister said recently that the Civil ( party democratic civic ) not fawn to the employers with inspectors . then , is ban or allowed ?
&quot; the law must be suppressed of some way and if prohibits something , in that case , not the President the government can prevent the action of the office that has the duty of to these controls not demand obligations &quot; , complaints fawn .
in the meeting of the Commission of control in the Congress of the Members , Ud. spoke the project common between the team Czech and the German , in the framework the which Karadzic the legislation which to the tenders public in both countries .
what is exactly ?
is of a control parallel that are to to ago a two years .
said of way accurate : the legislation European fawn how must organise the tenders public , to this you still the legislation existing in every country and , after , the these in .
us what we UK all and , although the control still not has complete , we successful differences very interesting . generally , the legislation of our country is &quot; more strict and more full &quot; , however , the these concrete in some parameters is better in Germany .
confirms , therefore , that not enough with integrate rules every time more stricter , but that is necessary focus in the implementation of the law same .
what can to of fact this project ? what believes that are the conclusions ?
precisely a control common of this kind could make to that Age of invest efforts in the that of the laws , the reduction and the improvement of the limits , although this not have a impact so positive .
the economy the savings means to a thing appropriate to a price reasonable ( what that not always means that the price be the more under ) for avoid so the enrichment and , to the long , the actions criminal .
but not the fact of reduce the limit of the tenders to say that we to this .
perhaps because the system is surplus with therefore &quot; tape &quot; , that those that want to failures in the system will do more easily that if the limits maintained so higher as now .
Ud. about of the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the fawn of the tenders public .
how works the system of controls in Germany ?
is a office analogous to our fawn or t of other way ?
in how to the offices , as the fawn , there it the fawn ( Court Federal of accounts ) , with a organisation similar to the our , with a school also , what only is that in their case is structured of a way a therefore different , but in principle both offices evolve parallel .
also the powers are to true point fawn , however , in therefore that Germany has a organisation Federal , the courts of accounts are even to this level . in this aspect from slightly of our system .
the Court Federal of accounts ( fawn ) only can control the money Federal , what that here call funds state .
the funds public , that are administered the regions and the municipalities , there , in Germany , monitored in the Court Federal of accounts .
in as to the legislation local , is more simple that the our ?
what general , not I like establish a compared data specific . not however , Germany still being a model in some aspects , but not can must with what in what is better .
could be better , example , in as to the quality of the inspectors ?
that sure that not , but , repeat , not I like to this kind of comparisons .
is necessary say that even those countries that we as model must to with to a great number of problems .
if not outside so , not them contribute no benefit cooperate with our office , not believes ?
in as to the legislation of our country , what meant for their office the amendment of law on the tenders public ? to of some way their impact ?
taking in account that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short , still not has said in the actions of control .
given that time controls former ex , is be have with a true delay .
now , is in the process of preparation of the controls future : we on a new tool of &quot; detection of risks not economic &quot; , the that we fact to almost 14.000 tenders public , that have been considered . the changes will perfectly about here , already that modify the limits , fawn the conditions of some types the process of selection and similar .
as that the adoption of this law is beneficial or that , more well , is a patchwork for the system bureaucratic ?
i that this law is surely a step in the direction right and hope that so be .
the problem that can eventually is that the regulation &quot; harmonised &quot; and that be impossible must .
already with the regulation previous , the people controlled were linked the contractor ( example , in the case of the programmes operational regional the Council regional ) , and every law not respected in on of tenders public mean the violation of the discipline budgetary .
has sense then tighten the law of this way ?
i that not of this way .
the system must from to those that want fawn or profit of he and not punish to those that commit a failure formal , that not has impact in the the of decisions .
a system of this kind only will create a greater pressure bureaucratic .
and how its of this ?
will towards where we has this way on .
the first Minister has declared recently that the Civil not fawn to the employers with controls the called system fawn , with reference the fact of be be only on the role . what means this ?
the system fawn &quot; is ban or allowed ?
the law must be suppressed of some way and , if prohibits something , then not even the first Minister the government can prevent the action of the office that has the duty of to these controls and demand obligations .
can say : &quot; fawn the law and what allowing &quot; , but not can say that we as if nothing .
in the law on the tenders public , the regulation is quite strict in as the way in that must act formally . and so is as must be for protect the competition public .
but , another on , is tragic that be the candidate with the better supply not to the demands formal .
the law never will perfect , but their implementation must be right . this is , in my opinion , what that we lack .

so up a programme that be attractive for all the generations , including the children .
example , in Prague fawn fawn , fawn fawn , fawn with are fawn , the fawn fawn , fawn fawn and Jiří fawn .
for obtain information more detailed , Now put www.kpks.cz.
you measures any other &quot; action witnessed &quot; similar in the future ?
in May we first time in the festival fawn fawn , so that here surely preparing a programme attractive with invited interesting .
the year that next also we like play in the fawn National Hall of new York and to me , personally , as that we in States United , I like amplify with actions in Washington and in Chicago .
fawn plans in the abroad not are precisely fawn , to now you action example in Madrid , Brussels , London or Moscow .
the fawn fawn is , not however , a group have people with disabilities .
how is the logistical and the organisation of these travel ?
not is so difficult how can appear to first view .
there five Member in wheelchair of wheelchair we , the chairs must travel in the stationary for luggage and also have a weight , the boxes with the instruments ...
however , to now we the we managed well . fawn and British major were perfectly prepared , thing that not is of puzzles .
even in Moscow , of where we their ago little , went all problems .
thank to the through the abroad Now for the different attitudes of the society towards the disabled and other aspects .
with what you you found to now ?
in Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other cities , all works better that here ; in Russia we been witnessing of that , in the this , is a way go .
to difference of Prague , Moscow is full of barriers , there still be often that a person properly single the centre of the city in a wheelchair of wheelchair we .
something so aware as is , example , to preference to someone in wheelchair of wheelchair in lift , there not what is .
fortunately , has created a partnership civil that striving fawn the problems of the people with disabilities .
in what aspects we take example of countries more progressive ?
there many aspects in the that we behind ...
but is important mention that the as and the improvement of the situation always on of the people to the that affects directly .
in London and in Madrid is very normal that the people with a disabilities serious properly their account in public and can go the service , the Museum , where wants ...
but not is very common that a great number of people with disabilities obtain in the life social of way active , in this aspect , with the fawn fawn ! we a little front fawn
a society pursue or barriers is a thing , but when it the time in the that emergence eminent athletes , artists , players , political or lawyers , start to change all of truth .
to now , are cases isolated of people that have a great force of will .
the group the fawn fawn is currently very popular , but if at a years back , what you was to be the group in 1998 ?
i as fawn in fawn fawn , where had very people young to my around that wanted their to something .
and since that I am musician , fawn , between other , the fawn , fawn a group healthier with a about of work .
and with the time , as says our mediating fawn fawn , we was a little of the hands ( laughter ) .
however , the popularity not came to these last years , or I wrong ?
is truth that we helped quite the fact of connecting with singers famous and also work actively for promote the group .
we to the conclusion of that the work that not is , is as if not existed .
thank to the aid of the Union European , we to also teachers of quality , equipment , etc.
belong intention of to so far with the fawn fawn ?
since the principle I the potential that had , that can to something of another way .
the world the spectacle is full of things that seem the a to the other .
is logical , to their way , all what new welcomes with caution and it a time in accepted .
there few things extraordinary , but I dare to say that the fawn fawn is a of them .
the impression of someone that we is first time is clearly the compassion , is a reaction natural ...
but the compassion is completely superfluous because the people with disabilities not are beings ruins that suffer and of the that we have compassion .
there people that is capable of live a life full and develop , with the condition , course , of that he of the media necessary .
I always say that if something them its well to people with disabilities , then , not is only a progress for them , but for whole the society .
helped the fact of that is Ud. a head assignment , as you describes very people ?
if we to a work of quality , we that be rigorous in many aspects and demand certain discipline .
i that is completely normal .
some people they with a vision romantic and with the head in the clouds and when usually that have that come two days to fraud , go to the test preparatory and to a time travelling and in concerts , the euphoria initial them or quickly .
but so is how works in all parties , in every group that to work and to something .
currently the group the fawn fawn has twenty Member .
many of them were already in the beginning the year 1998 ?
only one : fawn fawn .
we a group open , the people will and its , not can avoid .
who have will and wish heart always the doors fawn
will the day before the expected end the world , the Thursday 20.12.2012 to the 21 fawn
will place in the fawn bit of Prague , in fawn of fawn and in fawn in fawn and attending 12 groups and other musicians of the Republic fawn
the three cities fawn the end of the evening to through of video for I together the song the group the fawn fawn &quot; end the world , cancelled &quot;
the aim the of is together the resources necessary for funding equipment activities the centre education barriers fawn in fawn fawn of Prague , whose cost out to 25 million of billion Czech .
the entry the of costs 400 fawn and the children to 12 years have entry free in the option of sale early in fawn
Poland and the manage .
in the meeting of ministers of the countries of the agency Space European held the week last accepted to Poland as twelfth Member of the that . is the second country Member of the that the former bloc of Europe the this , after of the Republic Czech , that became in Member plenary the 12 of November of 2008 ) .
Poland set a intensive collaboration with the that in the year 1994 and for the years subsequent part in the Commission of projects of the agency .
however , the way of Poland towards the manage began a before .
the enthusiasts Poles already son to the flights the space before of the second war World , although not always about their work .
remember , example , the conference of A. fawn in the Centre astronomic of Warsaw in the that , the 6 of December of 1933 , presented their ideas on the study pioneering &quot; introduction to the drawing &quot; .
the ideas the young engineering ( born the 1905 ) was to the assistants indifferent and , years after , fawn us that the Dr. Jan fawn had been the only that had shown interest in their work .
in the year 1934 fawn successful in France the Prize Robert Esnault-Pelterie and fawn Louis as their &quot; introduction to the drawing &quot; .
the Doctor Jan fawn ( 1899 - 1966 ) , mentioned before , became more later in a great drive of the exploration and of the drawing .
published hundreds of articles in weeklies Polish and wrote a series of books dedicated to this discipline scientific .
fawn became in a promoter of the drawing , was known in all the world and their contribution to the science was rewarded when it their name to one of the fawn of the face hidden of the order .
already in the year 1925 was in Poland a fawn that was to be sanctioning of a engine of rockets .
unfortunately , unknown who was the author of the proposal and not know the fawn the project .
not is clear if the had was to be used for the testing of the fawn or for their slowed .
the information on this fawn limited to the after in the press of the time .
to from the year 1933 the it Polish began to their to the rockets .
the research was funded the fawn fawn fawn in collaboration with the fawn . fawn fawn and fawn . fawn fawn .
to from the material retained , ago clear that the research came the on of the evidence practices .
not however , with the arrival of the troops German , was the research .
in the year 1937 about in the press specialised the injudicious of a missile of hunting fawn designed the engineering fawn and the year next was published the study &quot; fawn - fawn fawn I fawn fawn &quot; , the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki .
both projects were for the use military of the engines for rockets .
little before of the war , the Committee advisory scientific provisional ( fawn fawn Doradczo-Naukowy ) responsible of all the projects of technical of rockets for use military and fawn all the jobs .
the Committee was founded in 1937 , but after of two years of activity , was interrupted the beginning of the war .
other studies dedicated to the drawing appeared in the press Polish after of the war thank the work of the society Polish of fawn ( fawn fawn fawn ) .
in the edition of November of 1954 of the magazine fawn ago reference first time to the society with four articles very they dedicated to the fawn .
in one of them , the fawn . M. fawn , proposed the creation of a society that devoted to the drawing .
in that time already had since in projects of satellites artificial and was obvious that the research cosmic was a discipline with prospects of future .
since principles of 1956 the society Polish of fawn ( fawn ) hoped to be part of the Federation international of fawn ( up in 1951 ) and in autumn of that same year the fawn became in Member plenary .
the year next the first President of the fawn , fawn fawn ( 1902 - 1959 ) , happened to be the of of the Federation international of fawn .
occupy this office to their death in 1959 .
to from the 1956 , the fawn part of way significantly in the development the had probe fawn ( fawn fawn ) , that was a success and became in the first had Polish in the that was to out research scientific .
the first kind RM-1 was complete in 1957 and launched first time the 10 of October of 1958 .
the had had a of of 1.800 metres , a 80 stated of length and not unable to the 5 kg of weight .
more later , end of build the version RM-1A and in summer of 1959 were the evidence airlines of the rockets RM-2 of two stages in the desert of fawn .
the had severs 1,4 metres and fawn a 11,5 kg.
another kind of had in development was to be subject of study scientific real . the had RM-34 was to have a of of 14,5 km and their mission would control the wind of all .
however , in 1962 cancelled the jobs .
the successor of the first rockets the kind fawn was the had Meteor-1 , that was for the years 1962 and 1965 .
fawn as had of two stages , with a length total of 510 stated and a weight initial of 32,5 kg.
proceeded three types ( called Meteor-1A , -1B and -1C ) , that differed between the space available for the equipment scientists .
in the had Meteor-1A the space available for the volume was of 0,4 litres , in the Meteor-1B of 0,34 litres and in the Meteor-1C of 0,62 litres .
the of maximum in the three types was of 37 km.
between the years 1965 and 1968 developed in the Institute air the had Meteor-2 , whose first evidence airlines were in October of 1970 .
the had Meteor-2 had a weight initial of 380 kg and was capable of to a weight useful of 10 kg to 60 km of all .
subsequently was the version Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 .
is necessary mention also the entry of Poland in the fawn ( Society at fawn Roslin ) in the year 1960 and the training the Committee national of fawn two years after .
in the framework the programme fawn , Poland joined to the research the space fawn on satellites artificial Soviet and , in the year 1978 , the pilot Polish fawn fawn became in the second fawn after of Vladimir Remek .
the from of the law on jobs social not is the solution .
the week last the who Constitutional suspended the law fawn social .
the resolution adherents a prevents discussion in the society .
since then will interesting at the Commission existing since a point of view more broader .
the systems economic Liberals in the EU , as that in the world globalised , based in the principle of a greater competition economic and least regulation .
in result , this means that the different forms economic and the systems economic national are in conflict permanent between .
the cause is in the principle the free trade and the movement free and unlimited of capital private , with with the speculation financial unbridled .
the effect of the large differences in the cost labour ( of the wages ) is tensions economic .
under this concept is necessary understand the situation in the that the manufacturer , with the imports of goods cheap , is shorten travel and for this &quot; from a fawn &quot; the price the competitor with the aim of done with the greater part the market and , of this way , increase their for of profits .
to great at means , for the majority of the employers , enterprises the production the abroad , buy there more cheap or well as . the result is a unemployment high in those countries in the that the price the work , in compared with other economies , is more high .
because to that the capital private not has responsibility social any and , with this , not is responsible the unemployment that this phenomenon generated , overall necessarily the expenditure social the state .
whole this situation being the total desirable of the employers pay tax and compensate the damage economic and social that have caused in their now of obtain profits .
the situation is universally so known that not is necessary it data statisticians specific .
the practices little fawn the capital private do situations , in certain economies , in the that the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of reduce artificially the level social of the own population and , of this way , attract capital abroad the country .
said of other way , the governments are capital private to available of their own population have in account the decline social .
this ago patent on all in the changes of the laws force .
the aim is force to the population to that accept the dictated the capital private , on all in what that as to the wages .
this has place , a part , by the system of duty economic in the case of unemployment of long an ; other , by the right restricted of the employees in as to rights labour .
the result is a poverty growing with with the increase of the differences between poor and rich .
since ago a series of years , there in Germany points of over of food for people poor that not can in with their own work .
the number of people that receive this kind of aid a already the million .
in the framework the increase of the competitiveness of the economy German , is a case quite often : people employed with a wage so under that the state must pay the rest for to the minimum essential for survive .
was public a scandal of this kind related with the situation of the employees provide the Parliament Federal German .
the measures of savings of virtually all the States the southern of the EU nowhere , place to doubt , to the same situation . the people , repeated a decline fawn of their level social , are forced to must as in the century nineteenth or to fawn with a wage rotten in the limit of the society , with the hope of that some day it the country capital investor private .
is necessary fawn of where next ?
in the case of that involved of other countries of the EU , then the poverty is of a country to another or not a never , since that Chinese , Indian , brazilian , Turks , Moroccan , Egyptians or African are working a tiny part of a wage European .
this also affects to whole America Latin .
the placed Liberals and the media of communication claim to the all that the state not should to capital to the economy , that you the economy leads to their failure .
the capital private it with tooth and European the i of that the state not should intervene in the economy fawn in the control .
to continuation , is necessary ask if the capital private not play with their egoism in the policy and , therefore , in all the state .
in this case the answer is clearly terms .
the test is the existence of lobbies , in the practice very powerful and curse , in all the States .
the result is a situation some that to in the area of the corruption , in the favours mutual , in a legislation that is virtually attitude in all parties but not is a .
in Germany the situation is the next : the ministries state , to lack of media financial , are the wording of projects of law to companies legal private , the which are to often linked with the industry .
this kind of projects of law are adopted after in the Bundestag , the Parliament German .
of this way , all the power not from the people , such and as is in the constitutions of the democracies Western , but of the strong groups financial that represent their own interests .
is obvious that the democracies with a it liberal are quickly in a situation how the that describes fawn in their labour the crisis of the Republic Roman in times of Caesar and fawn : &quot; the state was time fawn and the administrations within to the force &quot; .
to change of bribery , favours and fawn and aid for funding stones or revealed .
the using and the corruption spread from one and the people on to the ballot with the vote fawn of advance &quot; ... &quot; not had people with nature that fawn to a since in the administration , so that a time , to cause of this cost , the state was eight months consuls &quot; ... &quot; began to hears in seriously of that the only no for a situation so serious was the autocracy and that was necessary always a man extremely &quot; ... although fawn i in fawn , Caesar by the power and taskforce the democracy for always in autocracy .
the conclusion , the same way that in the old , is that the society current on in preference insensitive the benefit individual have in account the interests common .
the capital private not is capable , in their essence , of understand and ombudsman the profits of whole the society .
the result is the same that the of then , a quickly of the elite unprecedented , that she a effort for them in depth .
the causes the on of the regimes fascist and Communist must other , what therefore , in the liberalisation unbridled of the systems economic in the century nineteenth and which .
with respect to the situation current , is possible be the disappearance of these systems in benefit of a democracy of kind liberal , as a pause criticise , to the expected the next coup .
the fact really fawn is that the elite current ignores completely the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives , disasters social and humanitarian of the that we been witnessing , so as the crimes against the humanity , such and as the we in the history former and the more recent .
the from of the law on tenders public not is the solution ; the least not to long term .
under pressure of the competition economic , therefore to level international as within of the EU , the government of the Republic Czech be forced to to for other to for reduce the level social of the population .
this trend is , what therefore , systemic .
the solution is reforms fawn specific , that strengthen therefore the participation the capital the state as the influence of the citizens in the government and that weaken the position of monopoly the capital private in the society in benefit the state .
Israel : the laboratory the chaos .
&quot; that fawn fawn reducing fawn and fawn fawn could &quot; ( not from nothing of the violence and nothing could do ) , fawn in their song fawn and whose fawn He &quot; Let &apos; at do not fawn fawn fawn we subjects &quot; ( not we forget of what fragile that we ) .
&quot; if my children not is wars , not would no &quot; fawn fawn , wife of Mayer fawn Rothschild , in their bed of death in the year 1849 .
after of the last waves of violence between Israel and the Strip of Gaza , have that , as always , reactions various .
a , the on of Israel , it to favour the right of is and fawn to the Palestinians in the role of terrorists . the other supports to the Palestinians and referendums racism part the state of Israel , genocide by against Arab Palestinians and denigrated to Israel of state terrorist .
not i to in who is guilty of the massacres that are regular and who is the victim . the end and the out , the citizens of today in day of Israel , including the territories false , born within of the situation policy current and not lived the beginning of the violence .
my intention is offer to the readers a look behind the curtain , a look for be who out from of the tensions that affairs since ago 95 years ( calculated to from of the statement Balfour in November of 1917 ) in a small surface of land the East a .
some of my considerations based in facts historical , other in conclusions to the that I come on the basis of my own way of understand the issue , on who or what group of people is the drive main of the events of the history modern .
in the history of the humanity the history of the struggles the power is in first class .
in every time we find a Great Great or a Rostopchine .
but what that already not is so clear is if always were these eventual the that with their steps of way deliver or if behind of their Charles had someone that fawn their actions towards a particular aim .
we accept that we in a time that with the wealth the world in the hands of a few individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power that this means , not has been to in a single generation .
of between these families fawn richest least a that could be the more prominent ( if still there someone behind , not what know , but not what may ) : the Rothschild .
not says a to close of them .
course .
in the years 90 the century nineteenth bought the first agency of news ( Jazeera ) for that any of with their name with acts criminal of very serious . the power and the wealth , or both , them existence the back , thing that for them always meant a just .
have financially important in almost all the banks central the world and in those countries in the that not are represented , has declared or is about a war : before the attack to Afghanistan were 7 countries , after the attack of Iraq were 5 , after of bring to Gaddafi only they four , but meantime Russia has counts the Bank Central the government Russian .
all at that has tried against to this family has died .
Abraham is refused to renew the state the Bank Central Bank of America of the Rothschild , began for the war of Secession to anyway money and was murdered in 1865 in the theatre .
JFK started to anyway money and wanted decision the system of reserve Federal ( States ) and was murdered in 1963 ; the fawn Louis fawn fawn was poisoned the year 1936 after of to exceeding to the States have outrage the great crisis economic the year 1929 .
their now the power World them was for the years 1859 - 1871 to out a plan with three wars world , designed the fawn Shaw Pike , lights with the degree 33 .
the first war espoused as aim eliminate the large States fawn in whole Europe ; the second wanted eliminate the was colonial , especially of great Britain , and the third proposed reduce the population of the land between a million and billion million of people ( such amount of slave for their welfare and luxury would and not fawn many resources ) , also of the creation of a religion universal ( the fawn not is nothing more that a draft for such solution ) and the adoption final of the powers complete .
the method with the that operates the group of the families more richest , with with the Rothschild , still the dynamic the releasing of crisis and the of offer of a solution ( fawn fawn fawn - order to from the chaos ) .
these solutions are , however , flawed , and threat always a worsening of the situation . if not , enough remember that the States was created for that not nato a crisis as the the year 1907 .
so that , after the success the murder the as the Charles austro-húngaro , which Ferdinand , in Sarajevo and after of that , to as of this , erupted the first war World , Continent the Russia having with the beginning of the revolution defended .
the first war World over of way unexpectedly and unjustified since the point of view military and economic , the capitulation of Germany ( the wars for end with the Russia having were already unnecessary ) and the of firstly of the great power of Europe Central , the empire Austro-Húngaro .
for preparation the ground of the second war World , allowed that the bankers and political created , of way bloodless , a situation over to as of the enormous – of war imposed on Germany , with what that were the conditions privileged for the radicalisation of the there impoverished . subsequently , them sufficient with them to the Germans the solution the fawn , that was what enough strong and simple and that to guilty , and build after a Czechoslovakia states several Ukrainians with a strong minority German that should represent and was so well the role of the fifth spine , that fawn the is and resulted the outbreak of the war .
the end the century nineteenth , the Rothschild fawn the foundation the movement fawn , a an that hoped to the training of a state Jewish , out in the region of the former fawn with Jerusalem as capital ( return the fawn ) .
the statement Balfour this before did the foundation for the immigration mass of Jews to Palestine and they the first conflicts with the population Arab the place .
were attacks terrorists in both parties .
fawn the second war World : is difficult know if Hitler consigned too of the be to the that what they control the bankers international in a principle or if all what that was was part of a plan . however , the suffering of the Jews European in the camps of concentration was the conditions privileged for the acceptance the state Jewish in the society World .
Israel was founded officially in 1948 and , of way similar the way in that the – of war imposed to Germany emerge the way towards the second war World , with the proclamation the state of Israel was the spotlight for a third war .
if the bankers international succeed fawn , the nation Jewish , the as that in the second war World , would in victim in first line of combat , now with with the population Arab or , generally , Muslim the East a .
Israel is a laboratory in , a machine of solder and chaos , not only in the framework of their country , but also to at international . take as example how into of way totally the a and opponents of Israel .
who is guilty and who is the victim in the conflict palestino-israelí ? where the injustice marginalization injustice in a spiral of violence chestnut , if the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their now the power World ?
in this point is necessary distinction between the inhabitants of Israel and their authorised , because , the as that is in our country , the bankers international only have to their candidates in the elections .
the current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of political fascist , marketing to the bankers international , that ago all what possible for on the war to Iran and , at that Iran is Member of the organisation of cooperation of Shanghai ( China , India , Russia , Pakistan ... ) , threaten in become in a conflict global and , if we in account that Iran controls the close of fawn , where is the 20 % of all the oil World ( the corridor of navigation has only two miles of wide ) , would to the destruction of the economy World .
under what light show now the words that them David fawn in 1994 : &quot; what only that need is a crisis general and the people will of agreement with a new order World . &quot;
the new order World in their imagination is a world of Mr and slave .
a world in the that the rest of the population it to a handful of people that are part of the aristocracy financial well accommodated .
a world in the that to every new individual you up a chip the been that controls all their be .
&quot; and forced to all , small and large , rich and poor , free and slave , to have a mark in the hand right or in the with , to not power buy not sell , to not be that will the name of this monster or the figures of their name .
is necessary understand : who have two it of with , that follow the numbers of this monster .
the number mark to the person and this number is fawn sixty and six &quot; .
film element : if being oil , have to fawn
in November of 1979 a group of the demonstration of students Islamists took the Embassy American in Tehran and took 52 fawn as hostage .
their we in freedom was to be to change the fawn fawn supporting fawn fawn , the which after of the revolution received to EE.UU , country that had fawn their regime for decades .
for the administration American the situation not themselves no perspective positive : throwing the fawn the be not what could allow , since that , if what was , disposal in danger the confidence of their allies in other countries .
but the we in freedom of the hostage in Iran , where the revolution had led in the constitution the regime theocratic , not was to their reach .
was a coup the prestige of the States United , that subsequently intensified still more with the attempt failed of release to the hostage the force .
the diplomats they were released 444 days after of the intervention negotiating the government of Algeria .
in EE.UU. , their destination was a wave of solidarity and bear against Iran .
the failure in Iran played of way decisive to the defeat of Jimmy Jimmy with Ronald Ronald in the elections presidential of 1980 .
the film &quot; element &quot; the director and actor Ben fawn fawn a episode of this history , that fawn a small success for America .
little before of should the Embassy , escaped six employees the building .
after of a complicated fawn , ended in the residence of the Embassy Canadian .
CIA , in collaboration with the authorities Canadians , managed extract of Iran , for this helped a history Sky a point fawn : forthcoming with passports Canadians , as Member the team film that at the which in the country for the making of a Who of science fiction .
combination of fawn
the plan that laid the expert in &quot; fawn &quot; fawn fawn be the collaboration of Hollywood .
for that the lie existence divulged , wrote on the project film in weeklies specialist , organised conferences of press , the society of production farming had even a clearance real .
the details on the operation together in secret for a time , the film has fact to from of the memories of Tony fawn .
the film of fawn is a combination odd of several up .
a on , a fawn political realistic ; another , a called &quot; fawn fawn &quot; , the history of a episode that went well , a deception ( a example can be the series fawn &apos; at push ) .
in the film combined the States of mind . we a on fawn well it of Tehran . in the sequence of appropriations show photographs flagship of the time of the events , that were fawn the same way in the film ; not there many differences to this regard .
the another , scenes authoritarian of Hollywood a therefore more fawn , marked the irony and a corner excessive .
and also , scenes of the Central of the CIA and other institutions : men fawn that you the situation in the table of negotiations , in the corridors of the office , telephone ...
Ben fawn has managed restart their career of a way excellent .
the actor , that had been subject of ridiculed , has become in a director on and their way of act has longer of be the white of comments appreciates .
element is their third fawn , after of &quot; goodbye small , goodbye &quot; ( 2007 ) and the fawn &quot; the fawn . city of honour &quot; ( 2010 ) .
the same time , is the first film of fawn in the that the action not has place in the city of fawn , where it .
also , the sensitivity of warrant the atmosphere the place was a feature that light to the directors of films old above of standards of Hollywood .
and fawn what shows in element , where Tehran &quot; wheel &quot; in Canada .
the best scenes of the film have place in the streets , in the reconstruction of the events reported . the sequence introductory of the the of the Embassy is impressive their capacity fawn that , the same time , fawn the statehood the confusion and of the lack of foresight that from when , in some place , the history a step forward .
fawn and their colleagues obtaining a effect similar in the scenes bungled ( the team fawn in the bazaar of Tehran ) .
too action in many fawn
the director had that accept the fact of that a history explained not offers a in the sense film of the scenes more penalised .
and the you quite well . to sometimes you adds something to the reality : here not its all of way so you ( the scene in that which the crisis in the airport of Tehran , the deviating of a call to America and the for unbridled after their back become in a madness ) .
the fawn of element is the havoc that from of the need of show too action in many places .
Alan fawn and John fawn have a role very funny as colleagues of Hollywood , although their eventual deserved more space and not are , not a least , the only in this fawn .
these for , the film of fawn lose a little of further dramatic , but is a fawn that can to with a interest moderate , appreciate their realisation and the lifestyle fawn of a fawn that appealing the years 70 .
but that collapse , that will difficult .
as reminder of a history real and as test of what excessive that can be the concepts of fawn and fawn of the services secret , is enough .

a banana of quality must have a length of 14 centimetres .
the would of the Union the this kind of decisions to often under the pressure of one or another lobby law or industrial , whose petitions in Brussels are stood normally some state or group of States ( the Republic Czech , even with the threat of veto , eye the demands of their banks ) .
the interests of a lobby were behind of the request , example , of that the bananas of greater quality be have in the EU a length of what least 14 centimetres and not could it &quot; fawn shifting &quot; .

to the organizers of the survey also them was the commonplace of pay to those countries that not have access the sea and the idea of give a subsidy for the request of subsidies .
this class of ideas not EMS in Brussels but in Prague .
&quot; we in disadvantage the fact of not have sea .
we to the Union European a compensation &quot; , declared in autumn the 2004 the then Minister of agriculture fawn fawn ( fawn ) .
what destabilise with the fact of that in our country was a crop and , as result of the on purchases of intervention , the state had the stores in and had that export .
according fawn , given that the Republic Czech is far of the ports seaports , the EU should fawn hundreds of million of EUR .

mr Senator , how you happened stand to the elections for President ?
not is of be Senator or President .
if in our country outside all well , then not would my candidacy .
but already not can bear see how condemn in the last twenty years in our country , how the honour are go , increase the tax and the age of retirement .
not had ambitions of be political .
when see something that not I like , attempt to with a solution for .
and since that already have forty years and my candidacy is independent , the only possibility that have of change the things is coming as Senator or President .
the Senate already has come , but little after has since in way towards the Presidency .
not is giving the on to those people that what have voted ?
always I that my candidacy to the Presidency depended of the results in the elections the Senate .
more later fawn that if was elected Senator , would my candidacy to the Presidency .
but my aim not is the role ; the role is the tool with the that can to reality my own ideas .
that need the greater influence possible and the mandate more strong possible .
the problem not is only that us a nation that criticize in the bar or front of the television , but that fawn to who that wants to a change .
to this you fallen the media of communication , that you discredit and who the freedom of expression with the freedom of lie .
of me says that I fawn to journalists or that I been advisory of Jiří Jiří .
we to about of their ideas .
is to the fight presidential with i financial and responsibilities criminal of political and the statement of the property above of twenty million .
for this must change the law .
as President not has this competition and only the Senate in their whole can propose laws .
how to it ?
as citizen , I have part of a group of pressure for that the profession of on recognise as work be , and what we .
the problem is in the policy : if someone a with a good proposal , already be of right or of left , this to purpose and this affects to the citizens .
as candidate independent , have of a greater potential for obtain the support of all the groups Members .
fawn not undistorted of party , have the capacity of power always something of every party that be better for our country and apply .
as more well a man of right or of left ?
since the point of view Czech , have the impression that the people I as more of left .
for me not has importance , already be a little of left or a little of right .
what that I care is that want forward .
not I care if someone is of right or of left , i bring to the people .
always support openly any solution good , regardless of if the proposal next the fawn or of the Civil and , the same way , I in against of the poor ideas .
ago joke when says of Ud. that is populist .
but not what is proving with what that says ?
when creates a plan business for the company , you also certain objectives and ideals .
and fawn fawn to them .
will who what something populism , but all the proposals of the that i already work in the world or known experts speak of them .
but the support the Parliament only you are slogans .
and with this not can survive in the policy to long term .
or believes you that if at to the people and about with them , will , example , a responsibility criminal and financial ?
not have other option .
to to political , to journalists and to the society civil and try them of my part for this .
if outside elected President , not would problem in organise a broadcasting in direct television in the which would to the leaders of the parties Members that fawn the responsibility criminal and financial for political , officials , judges and tax the state .
and , eventually , them should that communicate why not what want .
if there a like strong that out the disputes , can to pressure in the scene policy .
take case the election direct the President , that has been a achievement of the pressure public .
the same time tell that only am a amateur , not am not a out not a intellectual .
for my views and ideals attempt to allies .
just of start in the policy and attempt obtain the greater support possible for my programme .
attempt from the things forward I same , but in case of that not it well , within of six years what contribution and back the sector private .
sounds a little as if fawn outside to save the Republic Czech .
not am no Salvador .
know that with a person not I nothing , that I visited to a series of personalities known , if to what better fawn to it their candidacy the Senate .
i to see to fawn fawn , but refused because had a work .
my part , what least I supported to the journalist of research fawn fawn , that his to the light the fraud with fruits covered of heating .
I I that of the basis of that the people is really dissatisfied , now am in the balance .
the sixty cent of the population not out to the ballot and , those that what did , voted to the representatives the wake .
in the Senate we two the sector independent .
the people was the Senate , of such way that will complicated achieve changes .
however , I defend my own ideas , as example the election direct of mayors or of governors .
is at be their own party ?
still not what I have because not have time for this , for check the last unblemished of every one of the potential Member the party , not not have money .
not have money not for the campaign to the Presidency , in my account transparent only there 20.000 billion .
not has money ?
about of statements of the property , how is the their ?
clarification my property private in a 60 million .
in Prague have a ground valued in 25 million , a out valued ten million , another out fawn in eight million , a now of works of art with a value of ten million , a fawn Martin of a 3,5 million and a fawn fawn valued in a million , and in the account have a couple of million .
true , have a fawn Martin because was my dream of young . always I pleased James rantings , that seeing this car , was fawn with the women and , the same time , elites against the fawn and injustices .
leads a fawn Martin , their property is valued in 60 million and not has money for the campaign ?
Ud. says that to change the Republic but not to to too money of their part .
not is very convincing .
not have 15 million for the campaign .
have that fawn ?
in the campaign already I since 2,5 million .
the fact of that not have no fawn shows that not there too interest in my programme .
and not have the duty of pay the campaign with money of my pocket .
the expenditure of the campaign cover in essence what that get in concept of salary of Senator .
but not could live of this . example , not could pay to my son the school English , that costs 30.000 billion month .
if like only earn money , then not I would as candidate .
so that will with their activity business for power live ?
not has said before that was to to this activity ?
this not has nothing that see with a salary greater .
as I promised , in part I longer my activities .
example , the representative of my agency of travel will to be my substitute in spring .
the people would that outside the fawn that fawn the Republic .
but I also need live of something .
how Portugal to earn monthly as his ?
between 200.000 and 400.000 , that I gaining .
if outside President , then commodities the business .
can put whole the interview in the edition the Saturday of fawn .
the study of architecture fawn shows that the real adventures not only are in the head - in the example of the library of fawn and the would despite &quot; mountain of books &quot; - 2 fawn
&quot; i that the building is fun , has a aspect fawn , and end there something interesting that see &quot; , says fawn fawn , a killed that is the street .
and stefan fawn , technical of you in a great company on close of the library , as : &quot; also , the building is it &quot; .

all we Internet , chlorine and books electronic .
nobody will will in these libraries past of fashionable , not ?
fawn , a city bedroom on to the doors of suggestion that hardly deserves a fawn visit , holds the questionable honour of have levies with a record for forget .
the population of 80.000 inhabitants is the rate of literacy more low of the countries Netherlands .
for to this situation so scandal , ago some years decided make of any way to the culture general and imitation the seven bridges fake that officer represented in the notes of euro in way of fawn of concrete arm fawn .
the success of the for amusing was limited .
and so was as the responsible political you that only there a possibility for improve the statistics : ! had that build a library fawn
fawn fawn , the study of architecture Dutch fawn , all a master in the art of the fawn of bars and responsible of buildings funny to the couple that Quai , took the issue with their her calm and lively to the presentation the an in the year 2003 with five books under the it and a lived in the face .
and while the jury telescope Oswiecim to their around and fawn of shoulders , fawn were to up the books size its a pyramid and brought their brief speech with the following words : &quot; ladies fellow fawn
here the you , my proposal for the mountain of books of fawn , the which fawn &apos; &quot; .
nine years after , the mountain of 30 million of EUR comments in the place to .
this way part the project of revival , that full with a parking underground , a supermarket , a office of post and a couple of buildings of housing and fawn .
to principles of November the mountain of books was medallists with the second Prize &quot; Impact fawn of NL 2012 &quot; .
also , the project also is fawn the &quot; fawn National fawn fawn 2012 &quot; .
of this way , the small city sake of history , that to the date not had nothing more that offer that a area smartest fawn and a City incredibly flicking after whose on White one fawn more well a Central country , account now with a labour of architecture contemporary .
but on all , fawn at now the first building cultural public of their history .
the long way to the fawn
the first impression is that is of a paradise of books under a fawn .
well is true that there a lift that we transported fair the centre of this poisoned fawn , but the real achieve the space and the reading not what use , but that prefer fawn with their fawn to every step of their escalation to the top .
the internal completely fawn is bright and easy of cover with the view , the soil of mortar fawn and the elegant fawn support of way unequivocally the condition public of the library .
the environment urban is perfect .
the raise the view can to to fawn the banks the park , the dogs and the children and girls playing the football .
and all both books , books and more books .
&quot; normally the shelves of books are willing to what long of the on and in the centre opens a huge room whites that , what general , is be something be and impersonal &quot; , says fawn fawn .
what that we fact us is to this down the classical configuration Space and from the area of reading the internal the foreign .
the internal of the mountain is very well tapped : in the a are the offices , the library of Internet , the club of being , the centre of education environmental and the room of peacekeeping .
is special deserve the shelves this that assuming the duties of coating fawn , fawn and fawn the same time .
the view , the you and the fawn are strangers .
even the architects and the engineers civilians more the day shake the head when already about of this material unknown .
&quot; we work with materials recycled &quot; , we it fawn fawn , head the project in the city of fawn .
and so is as a day , in a exploitation agricultural fawn , we brings with the animal appropriate from of the agriculture .
since ago many years , in the greenhouses and in the camps of the countries Netherlands used a fabric plastic of scarce cable of thick as basis for fawn the roots of the crops .
is of a material cheap and efficient .
this fabric fine hard two stations and after established .
for the library this fabric fawn , first time in such quantities , to to revised of four centimetres of thick .
with the heat and the pressure , the of plastic agricultural ( fawn ) time of colour and becomes in a material dark , harmonised and durable that of to a a of car new and fawn of sport .
after 105 steps a to the top of the mountain .
the end of this route continual of almost 500 metres around of the mountain we facing the to : since the cafeteria not only has a fantastic view of the city , but that in she also can enjoy of a beside fawn famous and their fawn planted in enormous flower .
these do a environment an to the couple that are the content air appropriate for this mountain of literature .
donations for a new fawn
&quot; although costs believe in their large land as , this building is a project exemplary in what that as to the ecology &quot; , out fawn .
the heating and the cooling necessary are to from of energy geothermal .
to despite of that the mountain of books is on under a huge pyramid of glass , even in the days more fawn the sun only which for few hours in their internal .
the enormous fawn of wood a in sense mind to the on of glass serve for to shadow and indicating the majority of the rays the sun .
this creates a climate internal fawn .
the rest is thing of the pulled it .
stefan fawn , the scepticism worker the sector of the technologies of the information , already has courage to to the ordinary in the new library .
and fawn fawn also has state there .
also , the teacher of medicine traditional China her fawn has visited the library . she described the &quot; fawn &quot; as the &quot; soul mention &quot; of fawn .
the reason is that , with reason of the opening that had place ago a couple of weeks , invited to all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book of their now private .
of this way to fill , of time , the bits fawn of a library that still not account with their archive completely ; in the today has 70.000 copies .
the concept has sure celebration .
the shelves are teem .
&quot; not there nothing worst that a library a empty &quot; , says the architect fawn fawn .
&quot; i that thank to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a true link with this building .
all know that their book way part of the library .
although only is there for embellish .
of this way , the study fawn has managed all a success in that discipline as that in the fawn specialises known as &quot; creation of a identity &quot; .
the city of fawn has writing a part of the history of the literature .
regardless of what young and fawn that can be .
end a point of starting for shaping their identity .
fawn : &quot; the Germans must play a role more leading &quot;
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine .
according instigation fawn , expert in the relations US . UU.-Europa , this at to Berlin in a position diplomatic quite tricky .
Deutsche fawn : to principles of week , Germany was to understand that would in against of the proposal of give to the territories Palestinians the condition of state observer of the nations UN .
however , finally Berlin abstained .
what ?
instigation fawn : Germany not supports what that the Israelis have fact in Gaza .
now well , because to the relationship special that unite the country with Israel , Germany must have care .
but the same time i that not supports the position American .
Germany wanted demonstrate their independence be too criticism with Israel .
for the embargo that had place in Libya in March of 2011 , Germany also abstained when of what that was was of establish a area of ban of flight .
this has been avowed finally the NATO .
you is difficult to Germany adopt a position clear when are in at subjects international important ?
, so is .
this must to that in these at is hindrance their policy foreign , moving of a policy led , so say , the States United and on in a policy foreign German .
and what that difficult still more the things is that the European not have a policy coherent and uniform .
what therefore , the Germans are in a crossroads .
of them expected that play a role more independent , but not are used to do .
i that still are operating what will their role , but already have on the way towards a policy foreign &quot; normal &quot; .
a policy foreign similar to the countries as France or great Britain .
what means specifically a policy foreign &quot; normal &quot; since the point of view German ?
is a policy that , when is of interests national , shows ready to defend clash different to the of States United or their partners European .
i that the policy foreign German is a strong motivation in the policy economic , is say , in the exports and in their relations with certain regions , as can be Russia , China or East next .
the interests economic Germans are to true point different to the of other large powers and that reason Germany must protect their interests .
these interests economic have affected in the position adopted with regard the conflict in East next and in the vote of the UN ?
a on , Germany account with large markets in East next , especially in the Gulf .
this reason must be poppy and not alienate of the opinion public Arab not not of the élite Arab .
this is important , course .
but I not you would so importance since that not is of a relationship completely unilateral .
however , play a role fundamental in the considerations German .
has attacked Germany their relationship with US . UU. the abstain of vote in important decisions as in the vote on Palestine ?
i that in Europe , and even in States United , the position German degree of a huge degree of understanding .
this reason , not i that has been a past so drastic as in the case of Libya .
perhaps with this Germany has achieved Leman a true respect .
the end and the out , all this not has fact but demonstrate that is a country the that take in seriously as actor international and whose interests there that have in account .
in Europe there different views about of the initiative Palestine .
in change , US . UU. has shown clearly to favour of a veto .
there differences of views between US . UU. and many nations European ?
always have been these disparities because to the policy internal US .
i that the government of Obama shows in secret a great understanding towards the position European .
but , to cause of the situation policy that lives here , is clear that the government not can defend in public that position .
i that the real differences of views not has in reality the which that you attaches .
if we the relations between Obama and the first Minister Israeli Netanyahu , we that Obama not is for nothing himself with the policy that develops .
you is difficult to Germany reconcile the links relations that in with Israel and States United , a on , with the position of their main partners in the EU , another ?
i that is precisely that what that ago that be so difficult for the Germans .
course that would a little more easy for the Germans if existed a policy European coherent and allowing , but not is the case .
what therefore , not have the possibility of be part of a Spain higher , but that must promote the things since their own position .
that is precisely what that are doing now with the euro .
i that in the future Germany will a role of leadership to the time of force to Europe to adopt a position European .
course that this not is nothing easy for Germany , already be simply the relationship that in with Israel .
this has been always a issue tough .
but i that the Germans have clear that must play the role of on independent .
is Germany to same in the role of actor international important ? to in reality Germany in a role leading ?
or perhaps you still finding difficult accept that leadership ?
Germany still not has have , always is something you and , for obvious , the country you still collapse play a role more important .
if we the crisis the euro , example , we that every time that Germany I as actor main , when certain feelings fawn .
this not is easy for the Germans .
is of a old problem and is that nobody to be surrounded of the countries enemies .
seen of this way , Germany is in a position a more difficult that States United .
must show a attitude inclusive with to the different neighbours and views and that not is easy .
the influence of US . UU. in the policy European ever every time more , but the EU not cover of time that we , who is then ?
to the Germans not them will more no that in a role more leading .
even if not them like , if them is unpleasant or if them becomes in a people still more unpopular , c &apos; la the vie fawn

&quot; protection of trademark &quot; in China : when fawn and walking become of suddenly in trademark fawn
walking is a mark known to level World and side fawn fawn also .
but , what is walking side ?
after this name behind a designation EU officially in China but that not has nothing that see with the companies original .
not however , this degree of protection while the real fawn not be a demand .
and even then not is clear that them will to to the reason .
&quot; to the foreign them is every time more difficult protect their trademark in China &quot; , out he fawn , lawyer the fawn an fawn specialises in violations of rights of protection in extreme East .
every week a to my table a new case .
the imitators simply in a couple of you for power record their trademark .
of this way , fawn becomes in Lu-Gucci and in place of fawn with Prada-Kny .
the companies German also copied legally of the same way , such and as you has happened the manufacturer of articles sports fawn .
fawn opens a locked in the that have seats of the office of trademark of Beijing .
the 14 of September of 2010 a company China which record the mark fawn fawn fawn , a name artificial that also i of the home of fashionable fawn fawn .
that the Chinese are champions world in that of imitation and of all the rights of property intellectual is of too known .
in the large cities there large stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeiting .
however , the cases of fawn are of other a . charge of their customers , he fight against the fact of that the office of trademark granted of way official to the companies Chinese the right to from from of a designation that already is EU in another place .
the Chinese what refer &quot; bang fawn fawn &quot; or mark his .
the word has their origin in the term Chinese &quot; bang fawn &quot; ,
that ago reference to women that have &quot; fish &quot; to a man Puerto .
the authorities Chinese not feel fawn
&quot; is harmful for the business , there that fight against this &quot; , requires fawn .
&quot; the mark ago waters , the position monopolist disappears and the damage that suffering the image is huge . &quot;
the losses financial and the as procedural of the sectors affected are fawn , on all in the case of products flagship of luxury .
according data of the company of analysis of market fawn , with a volume of 15.000 million of EUR the year China is , in size , the third market of articles of luxury and the that overall to greater pace .
however , achieve the seeking of enrolment of doubtful legality in the registration of trademark is complicated and also is a money .
the processes can over to nine years and the result is uncertain .
fawn about of cases in the that the Court rejected a demand because had Objective therefore time that the name subject of the demand already had become in a &quot; reality of market &quot; .
&quot; if the they has bad fortunately , perhaps even have that pay money the fawn because the process has damage to the mark of this in China &quot; , out fawn .
in times this is the law of the jungle .
some of the cases more known have that see with elements graphic .
in 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a he against the manufacturer of machinery of construction fawn , the company that has been taken ago little the manufacturer German of bombs of concrete fawn .
that to day of today the Chinese can to being a emblem very similar to the star of Mercedes .
the one of Volvo , fawn , his the principle a logo in white and Blue that us in great measure to BMW ; the issue fawn in the courts and fawn had that happened .
the manufacturer of clothes fawn lost in China against imitators from of Hong Hong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile eye in the direction opposite the original .
the authorities Chinese not feel guilty .
the office of trademark fawn in Beijing recognised that in 2010 have had difficulties because to the shortage of equipment and funding of personal .
the year last , however , &quot; the situation of emergency labour the to the as &quot; .
of this way , the amount of processes of complaint fawn has small in a 22 % .
almost 57.000 of these cases worked been , a 75 % more that the year previous .
however , 81.500 complaints are outstanding of resolution .
fight against this costs a fawn
as is be her in China , the figures are surprising .
the year last the fawn registered more of 1,4 million of applications of protection of trademark , almost a third more that in 2010 .
would of a new record and means that China fawn tenth year running the list of new enrolment in all the world , according out the office of trademark .
seems that this also happens with the number of which valid , figure that out to 5,5 million in total .
in 2011 would fawn 1.800 million of typhoon in concept of rights .
said of other way , this means that of average every for costs 1.280 typhoon or 160 EUR .
fight against this costs a money , such and as shows the case of the company family German fawn .
since ago more of seven years the group principal in the courts against a fawn Chinese .
if well the Germans have managed stop the manufacture illegal of parts of car of imitation ,
the fawn has achieved ensure the rights Chinese on the mark fawn .
&quot; us ourselves we caused this situation because in Germany the surnames not are protected &quot; , out fawn fawn , President and fawn fawn of fawn fawn fawn in Munich .
the office of trademark fawn also rejected the appeal of the fawn .
in the two following bodies you have given the reason to fawn , but the part opposite still fronts in the today .
there that have great fawn
now the case has come to the doors the Court higher of justice , where still outstanding of resolution .
fawn responding in power resolve welcome the question and rationale the professionalism of the courts .
however , also says that &quot; the procedure is extremely expensive , therefore in terms of money as of time &quot; .
is difficult estimate the costs internal ; the archive business has had that review dossiers of to hundred years of old for power to evidence .
ago five years fawn promised to the part opposite a &quot; sum of six figures in EUR &quot; with the aim of to to a agreement friendly , but not had success .
&quot; this shows what a that we care &quot; , out fawn .
the dangers that ageing in extreme East threat even with affect to Europe ,
specifically if the imitators they there the rights on trademark not protected .
so , a manufacturer Chinese tried record in Germany the name fawn for shoes and products of fur .
ago time that the group occasion this area trade , not however in prevent the for .
&quot; there that have great care &quot; , says fawn .
therefore he as the lawyer fawn proposed to the companies German that are extremely careful to the time of to business with China .
not enough with rely in the legislation international on rights of mark , but that what that there that to is &quot; record also in China all for that can be for of protection &quot; , such and as as fawn .
of what contrary , the issue can be a more expensive that a simple registration .
of fact , in case of that fawn avoid the last assault of their battle particular , then would that pay to the part opposite rights of licence their own name , such and as it fawn .
that or in the segment in question we fawn the market .

in this room nobody know about with fluidity this language fawn , but I know .
since ago ten years this chorus trying songs in this softly language foreign that in times by fawn to their place of origin : the southern of Africa .
to 8.733 kilometres of distance in line straight since Druckmaschinen , in the deliver the UK of Swaziland , there a people called fawn that on of the voices of this chorus German .
the forty cent is fawn
approximately 2.000 people live there , some still in simpler they of fast and mouth , a great part of them are children .
more of 300 already not have parents because have succumbed the AIDS .
fawn is a small example of what that affects to Swaziland : the rate of infection of AIDS more high and the hopes of life more in of all the world , according UNICEF .
the population not is with good eyes the circumcision , a practice that according has shown reduces to the half the risk of infection .
more the 40 % of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carrying the virus of the line , and die with something more of thirty years has become in something her .
for a journey whole to Africa in the spring of 2005 the chorus found this fawn population , but what that were on all were many children in the streets that which not only of the protection of their parents , but of what main : food , clothes and training .

fawn : the NASA which ice in fawn

probably the layer of ice have a thick of to 20 metres .
the NASA , the agency Space American , has has evidence of the existence of ice in mercury .
to despite of be the planet more have the sun , there also there water fawn , such and as from of three studies published the Thursday in the magazine specialised &quot; Meat &quot; .

our window the universe : the fawn more fawn
seems that the telescope was invented Hans fawn in 1608 , before of that Galileo Galilei what possibly a year after for it the stars .
since then , the mirrors of the fawn fawn not has unemployed of grow and the images that we offered have every time more depth .
for 30 years , specifically of 1947 to 1975 , the telescope fawn it in the Centre fawn close of St Garcia was the more large the world .
their mirror , in the image , had a distance of five metres .
in coldest , US . parts . , comments the Families fawn fawn .
this allows it the manage to through of two mirrors , every one with a distance of 8,4 metres .
the internal the great telescope Canary it in the island of the Palma is huge - only the mirror has a distance of 10,4 metres .
the mirror the Southern Southern Families fawn in Africa is fawn for save costs .
despite to this , high a distance of approximately eleven metres .
the these of this construction more economic is that the telescope has a angle of raising make , what that their mobility is limited .
the telescope Hobby-Eberly in Minnesota also has a angle of raising make .
their fawn is their huge capacity for up light .
to despite of have with a distance of mirror comparison more small , this capacity is seventies to the of the fawn of mirror more large the world .

these have with two mirrors , every one of them with a distance of 10 metres .
the fawn fawn are part the Centre fawn fawn , that with to them fawn the sky with the aid the telescope fawn and the fawn .
in fawn fawn is to build a new telescope of enormous scale and with a distance of mirror of thirty metres .
this is a image of how would .
however , the information more important the manage we a of the hand the telescope Space fawn .
since the 24 of April of 1990 are images of worlds distant .
since March of 2009 the telescope Space fawn search planets fawn , mainly those that are liveable .
the 2 of February of 2011 the NASA announced that since the beginning of their mission had permanently 1.235 candidates to planets .
in the image are the last preparations very the launching the telescope Space fawn .
the telescope James fawn fawn fawn ( fawn ) not launched the space to board of a had 5 to 2018 .
the mirror maintenance of this telescope Space has a distance of 6,5 metres .
a of the duties of this telescope will to the light of the first stars and Star charity after the bang bang .
the researchers proceed of the basis of that in the side southern of mercury also there ice .
however , not there evidence Instead , since that the probe fawn this in about the planet in a about a more their the side North .
since ago decades the measurements of lighting invite to the existence of ice in mercury .
thank to the probe fawn ( 2004 ) , the first that earth in about to mercury , now the scientists have the certainty of that is so .

however , the star an the Museum is the sheep of sheep fawn fawn , that seems have through 168 years .
not however , not there no starting of birth that what fawn .
and if we in account that the man of greater age detailed lived 122 years , seems that the age of fawn is quite suspect .
&quot; born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973 &quot; , we it fawn .
the man was married in three times and had 23 children . the appear still had time of conceive a daughter more to the age of 136 years .
has wrong then fawn fawn in their age in a couple of decades ?
however , fawn fawn , fawn in the Institute charisma fawn of door , also has heard about of the elderly age of this head of Asia Central .
&quot; in some regions of China , Japan or in the valley of fawn in Pakistan also live people of age very elderly &quot; , says fawn , &quot; even in Sardinia there many men over &quot; .
because to the lack of documents , is impossible to evidence scientific about of the age ; very when not there no registration civil .

demonstrations that vying between in the Cairo are of clear the grossly division in the that is desperately the country .
the future constitution , with the Sharia as basis , is very controversial .
the President Egyptian not saw in pathos .
&quot; we overcome the transition .
and that that happen is my responsibility , to the people and to God &quot; , said in the television public .

of fact , the 234 articles , whose adoption has been forced a House assembly states 100 Member overwhelmingly Islamists in a meeting quality of 15 hours of an , are truly worrying .
as in previous constitutions , in the draft also says that the for on in the &quot; principles the right Islamic &quot; .
however , what means that of &quot; principles &quot; ?
this was and still be open to the interpretation and seems that the Islamists will to take this vague he , so as the for of manoeuvre legal that has honour , for impose a interpretation more strict of the Sharia .
this is the least what that suggests a new Article added : in all the issues relating to the Sharia is compulsory put to the University Al-Ashar , the institution Islamic more important the country with a great power in all the an Sunni .
not has what be so , but this can mean that the clergy monitored the legislation , something that - of fact - would as result the ’ of the judiciary .

true that no Article for of way explicitly the equality between men and women .
in change another prohibits offend or punished the Prophet rapid and to their travelling .
however , not is clear what is a defy and how has of be sanctioned .
as of doubtful is the he that prohibits the &quot; defy to the people &quot;
is enough a as the President or a joke on a fawn ?
question of interpretation , as many other things in the draft that has been tabled to fawn for their signing and that according , their words , &quot; very soon &quot; will tabled to the Egyptians for be subject to referendum .
&quot; the revolution has again &quot;

a fight the sovereignty of the symbolic place Square , where started all , would caused a situation similar to the of a war civil .
is clear that the supporters of fawn not wanted avail to that something so and .
the Muslim Muslims said that therefore the that who the draft of the constitution as the supporters the same would expressed their views high and clear .
now would come the time of to that the people bore in the ballot what direction should to the country .
in this sense , seems that the draft of the Islamists has transaction the majority .

however , the another on the state that not is the impression that has very people on their former Governor .
in fawn , known also as city fawn , the contrast with the streets fawn of valley the bravo not could be greater .

however , that is exactly what that the family says that you has denied .
&quot; the authorities the state I have Treaty as if outside a old fawn , a fawn , a fawn .

my crisis of identity mexicano-estadounidense
says that many were forced to leave Mexico because to the lack of fawn
the Mexican tend to criticise to the that were ; says that reminiscent to the Mexican of those times fawn
fawn observing that the mexicano-estadounidenses are trapped between two worlds .
in a recent journey to city of Mexico , hardly had down the on and come to the area of has of immigration and already was completely confusing .
a notices did the way towards two on : a for &quot; Mexican &quot; and other for &quot; foreign &quot; .
I was there a seconds be sure towards where should go .
the have grown in California Central , for whole my life I have called &quot; Mexican &quot; .
is of fawn ethnic , the same way in that my friends of fawn are to ourselves as &quot; Irish &quot; or my friends of new York as to ourselves &quot; Italian &quot; .
more later I decided &quot; mexicano-estadounidense &quot; .
but this was Mexico .
and , in the homeland of my grandfather , the fawn or the plus not were necessary .
simply was US .
i Spanish . what enough well as for fawn for a interview in this language .
but not have the level of vocabulary of a fawn and not can fawn of my accent American .
so that I my passport US and I I in the EU of foreign .
thought in at time of this week in the that the President elected of Mexico , eight fawn grandson , visited the home White for meet with the President Obama .
in the agenda the day , as always that meet the leaders of these two countries , communists : immigration , drugs and trade .
fawn grandson was look about also the growth of the economy Mexican , a of the reasons the that in these at is so likely that a Mexican be in Mexico as that draft to go to the States United .
to partner with States United and Canada and create in America a bloc trade the lifestyle of the Union European .
also , fawn grandson promised to fighting against the which of the drugs in Mexico , although not was details .
for Mexico , the relationship with the States United is difficult and is full of grudge .
probably the majority of Americans never remember of that in 1848 the States United invaded Mexico and his to their leaders to yield the half of their territory to is of at .
but for the Mexican , that think in centuries , not in minutes , the elements that what reminiscent are all parties .
so that , in the time in the that a official of the States United says any thing that such the more minimum criticism to Mexico , fawn to hear complaints , therefore in the press as between the elite Mexican , on how the Americans are fawn the sovereignty of their neighbours .
and the children of fawn are in ordinary of war .
and still so , for Mexico , the relationship that really is all a challenge is the that have with the more of 35 million of mexicano-estadounidenses that live in the States United .
we of grudge ?
there a .
in Mexico there winners and losers , people for the that the country provided opportunities and other for the that not is so .
the only reason the that there many people of Hungarians Mexican living in cities as the Angeles , the fawn , as , Denver or St for is that , in some point of our tree fawn , there a person , can that the father or the mother or one of the grandparents , to the that you closed the door of the opportunities in Mexico and had that leave towards the North .
and the majority of the sometimes that person fit in a profile particular : fur whites , a level of studies under , from of a people poor , etc.
us we their see and them we loyal .
to Mexico not .
and , to despite of that perhaps we living now the dream American , the have gone to good schools and have had good jobs , not we lose never of view that what that we living is that , the dream American , and not the Mexican .
is possible that to sometimes our identity not is clear , but our kept that what is .
is for the States United .
also , we aware of that to many of the Mexican lot to the elite of the class leader not them fawn .
the sense is mutual .
we are as a reminder of a defeat humiliating and we who above the card as if about of a category than that not is what enough Mexican .
our Spanish never will what enough good and our links with Mexico never will what enough strong .
to their way of see , our existence is synonymous of failure .
if our families not would failed in Mexico , not would gone .
and now not we be trapped after this significant of wrap , living well in the States United but , still so , as souls fawn .
my woman , that born in Guadalajara and wine legally to the States United when was a girl , I reminds that there this fawn between the Mexican and the mexicano-estadounidenses because the first know with more strength who are and to the seconds this them bother .
although is citizens of the States United , she as part of the two countries .
while therefore , many mexicano-estadounidenses that know feel that not are part of none of the two .
we love listen the group Mexican the Tigers the North , but also to fawn fawn .
you what better of every country , but not with hold to none of them .
in Mexico we are as Americans .
and in the States United we as Mexican .
now , for more still more the things , what that I I have for my journey , some leaders Mexican and some intellectuals want again to connecting with the diaspora .
want that the mexicano-estadounidenses work as &quot; ambassadors &quot; of Mexico makeshift , been their interests in the States United .
fawn to our colleagues Americans what fantastic that is visiting that country and fawn to the leaders political for that fawn their links with Mexico .
, clear ...
that not is to to .
there too grudge .
and , with the inequality of wages , the corruption rampant and the violence drugs , many of us not we so insurance of that be a country fantastic .
I fear that you Sötét to be alone with this idea , friends .
is fair .
if some Mexican still not are prepared for pardon to the States United the way in the that were to Mexico ago a century and a , then have that accept the fact of that some mexicano-estadounidenses still are begrudgers how was to their family ago great least time .
fawn .
perhaps us more &quot; Mexican &quot; of what that i .
this battles , new East fawn
the high the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas well could be a basis little likely for the fawn
will have some day a peace lasting between Arab and Jews in East a ?
another bloodletting of blood that seems indicate that any hope is in vain .
in a of the so and arise further on who began first , countless of buildings have been lower to rubble ; more of 140 Palestinians , the majority of them civilians , and six Israelis have been killed and , first time , rockets from of Gaza have fallen close of Aviv Aviv , the mainland of Israel , and the city Holy of Jerusalem .
but , to despite of that the Israelis and the Palestinians seem be sections in their former conflict , all as them are in East a is changing .
the spring Arab what has longer all fact dirty them whether or not , Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the mighty regional .
perhaps this do that their fight be still more bloody that before .
however , there reasons for think that their lethal situation of point died could fawn .
a war that not lose not fawn
to first view , the optimism seems currently very difficult of justify .
even if in the high the ceasefire agreed the 21 of November , the clashes of this week have reinforced to the hawks of both sides .
the leaders of Hamas , the movement Islamist that has run Gaza since 2007 , have have forced to the Israelis to from , to despite of that Gaza has received a good him .
and to despite of have killed to some of their leaders and trouble to pressure to the 1,7 million of inhabitants of Gaza in one of the they more squalid and bound the planet , Israel not has been end with Hamas .
of fact , Hamas is gaining ground in Bank , the other part of Palestine currently ruled their implacable rival of Fatah , the fawn Palestine more moderate .
also , the leaders of Hamas could to to the conclusion of that the time is to their favour .
given that the Islamists have gone gaining influence all the world Arab , Hamas has fact fawn richest and powerful .
Turkey , a fawn power regional that before had been the ally Muslim more have to Israel , has espoused the cause of Hamas . also what has fact Qatar , one of the States more rich and dynamic the Gulf .
the fawn Member of Hamas say that the average order Islamist is generals Israel , since the Lebanon the North , where dominates the partido-milicia fawn , happening Syria , where the rebels of a trend every time more Islamist could bring to fawn by , to to to Jordan , where the allies of Hamas are threatening the King .
on all in the with southern of Israel , the growth of the Muslim Muslims targeted the President fawn fawn in Egypt , with difference the more populated and fundamental of the countries Arab , has changed the balance of the region .
Hosni Mubarak , the fawn quarters that period in Egypt for 30 years to their fall in 2011 , not had too time for Hamas .
in change , the Muslim Muslims are cousins Muslim of Hamas and their leaders on more of the opinion popular .
in future actions diplomatic , is possible that Hamas could as leading the that not can from , not even Israel and the States United .
while therefore , the arrived hard of Israel surrendering the conclusion opposite .
in what that as the question military , have since to Hamas in their website .
the system missiles fawn of iron of Israel has shown their effectively and many of the rockets of Hamas have been destroyed .
the Israelis fawn more so ... for some time .
in as to the diplomacy , States United shows more firm that never ; many countries European also fawn to Hamas of have on the last wave of violence .
to all , Israel has been . especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu , a first Minister that has ignored this the process of peace .
although the rockets fired since Gaza have over with the life of a 30 Israelis since 2004 , Israel not has had many terrorists suicide , in part thank to the barrier that fawn Bank , the main part of a territory aspiring to become in state of Palestine , and it the settlements Jews that are increasing to despite of that , according the legislation international , are illegal .
the Sr. Netanyahu , whose party fighters has UK to a group of a line still more hard by fawn fawn in the period become to the elections the 22 of January , is in a good position .
what fawn to these fawn Palestinians fawn a state own ?
if really fawn in Bank , not fawn rockets such and as have fact their compatriots in Gaza ?
is better ! after that Wall and them a good coup if rose the head .
perhaps will the arrived hard , although the spring Arab could tamper their are .
although the Islamists that take the power in Egypt and in other websites not have too hold to Israel , their priority will address the difficulties internal .
the budget of defence of Israel is greater that the of their four neighbours Arab together .
to a war with the superpower of the area hardly will to the new governments Arab to improve their economies .
that the may Sr. fawn has worked with Barack Obama for to the high the ceasefire is a good well and could drive the beginning of something .
also the Israelis should think to long term .
with the rest the world Arab whenever more democratic , deprived to the Palestinians of their right to the am is create a volcano that a day fawn in the territories occupied Israel , of the same way that this week constable a bus in Aviv Aviv .
the repression already is destroying the democracy in the state Jewish and the demography worse the situation to measure that is the population Arab .
the fawn missions against Gaza every two or three years for reject to Hamas they a toll diplomatic every time greater .
both sides need a right of people which the conflict .
the solution still being the that fawn people sensible of both sides , the majority the world foreign and this newspaper : two States and the bid of territory part of Israel reasons of security .
the hope , small to short term , is that the high the ceasefire given a little more of momentum to the people which that are fighting this cause .
Egypt , that must start to to curb to the entry of weapons in Gaza , with with Turkey and Qatar , is in a situation unprecedented for to to Hamas of that accept the idea of a state Jewish based in the borders of 1967 , with exchanges of land and a Jerusalem shared .
the Arab spokesmen the issue also should pressure to Hamas and Fatah for that join .
that help more to the creation of a state Palestinian that the imminent attempt of obtain a category of state virtual in the UN .
the Sr. Obama also has a important role in what that as to to to to Israel to the table of negotiating .
for their first mandate fawn it their own plan for the peace .
of new in the home White , seems as of reluctant to unique their attention .
this attitude is a deplorable vision of future .
a East a stable is of vital interest for the States United .
this means a agreement of peace between Israel and Palestine .
the law of rapid nitrofurans of tobacco will in force in fawn
warnings on the risks of smoking and parties the body with diseases fawn on packets of a off colour green , that are the same for all the trademark of fawn
the law – in on of tobacco and rapid nitrofurans , europe in the world , will in force and On the which and the colours of the trademark a fobbed of a off green olive , a appalling images of parties the body with diseases and photos of children and babies people be children of parents smokers .
to exception of the various images and warnings health , the only difference between the packets , can since the Saturday , are the names of the trademark , all them printed in a kind of source small .
is the regime more narrower the world applied the rapid of tobacco .
the government Federal of Australia says that the aim is could to the young of smoking by the elimination of the broad that do that this habit have fawn .
responding in studies that shown that if a person not has started to smoking before of the 26 years , there a 99 % of for of that never what do .
&quot; can see that the children , even since very early age , understand the message that the company tobacco is trying sell to through of their mark &quot; , said the Minister of health Federal , fawn fawn , quote studies that aggressive , example , how the girls fawn the logo of a crown with the idea of be a who .
to despite of that Australia account with a of the rates of smokers more in the world and that these changes not will too to the profits of the multinationals , other countries are at take measures similar .
the industry tobacco has that a pressure huge in against of the law .
the companies producers said that the law enterprise the market black of tobacco , in the that the cigarette would more cheaper and more accessible .
&quot; the legislation comply serious consequences do &quot; , said Ayr fawn , of the British American Tobacco , in Australia .
will the amount of tobacco that bring the counterfeiters of China and Indonesia for marketplace in the streets of Australia .
other people say that their business has benefited after the adoption of the law .
Sandra has , of fawn fawn fawn co , a small company family , said that the demand of fawn and covered of implants for loopholes the unpleasant images of the packets had ring almost since zero ago two months , when the British American Tobacco , fawn &apos; at deciding Tobacco , Philip Morris and also Tobacco lost a weakening to the law in the Court Supreme of Australia .
the Sra. has said that fawn had sold to 6.000 units to establishments trades and that was waiting more stocks .
&quot; for us is a good business &quot; .
according the experts , the possible obstacle is the popularity of the networks social between the sector demographic the that at the plan .
after a series of laws collecting that prohibit the advertising in the television and the sponsorship of sports and that on to the majority of sellers to not to the cigarette to the view , the marketing the tobacco has last to take in line .
Australia has ban the advertising in Internet to companies and pages website local , but not can fan in pages foreign .
&quot; if fawn tobacco and so only you is this small window for promote your products , the space in line is the place more convincing in the that be &quot; , said fawn fawn , it of health public of the University of established .
fawn observed a increase of appears on trademark from of &quot; citizens of to ordinary &quot; premises in pages website of networks social as YouTube , Twitter and Facebook .
is ask if is so only of a citizen private to who really you crazy the cigarettes fawn and has taken the trouble of to a video or if any company of marketing is behind of all this .
the British American Tobacco of Australia pressed that the industry on more in what that means the regulation new that in the marketing .
the industry has come even to pay for that Ukraine , Honduras and the Republic Dominican fawn the new rules ; these countries are saying to the organisation World the trade that is becoming the trade unfairly , to despite of that none of these countries has a volume of trade significant with Australia .
is likely that the WTO dictate a resolution to in of 2013 .
fawn said that the government had had discussions with other countries that are at apply laws similar in on of rapid of tobacco .
in the year 2001 Canada became in the first country that introduced the mandatory of include images in the packets .
currently are can in more of 40 countries , between the that are Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine .
in great Britain , new Zealand , Africa and India is at apply laws more tough .
in Australia many smokers show words .
&quot; the photographs not I affect .
simply not them I case &quot; .
&quot; fawn the fawn and guards the package &quot; , says Messmer the fawn while buying a package with the image of a by in the their .
&quot; sincerely , only there a reason the that commodities of smoking : my daughter . &quot;
James fawn , workforce the fawn King of the Pack in the centre of established , that that the packets uniform do that you it more complicated getting in the shelves .
&quot; normally reported a time in fawn a over ; now fawn four &quot; , says fawn .
&quot; the government should have ban completely the tobacco and then , already is , is , over and they the shop &quot; , says while comments the hands towards down .
in a world constantly logged , not is so dull a fawn
for the testing the day of action of thank of this year , of way unexpectedly had that to five hours in a airport because the air in the that fawn was a problem engineering and had that wait to that would another air .
so that had great time for think in the platitude .
not you i to lie .
fawn a day in a airport waiting to that it a flight is quite boring , even if you media for be Have , as books , weeklies or fawn , ignore of the shops duty-free .
but every time there more academic and experts in development child that praising the shot the platitude .
according them , is well that , therefore us as our children , we fawn of time in when .
dull forced the which to to options interesting and can that encourage the creativity .
given that , currently , the majority of us we connected to this or to that screen , not we the profits that provided the platitude .
so that , should accept of good mind the platitude ?
.
and not .
but , already we of this more forward .
in first place , the as that very people , supposed that , now that have of more time for the leisure , the platitude would a phenomenon relatively recent .
but , such and as says Peter fawn , professor of history Greek and Roman of the University of Calgary , in Canada , and author the book &quot; fawn : to fawn fawn &quot; ( &quot; the platitude , a history encouraged &quot; ) published in 2011 fawn University reporter , not is so .
&quot; of fact , the history the platitude is very can &quot; , says .
in the walls of fawn there fawn in Latin on the platitude that dating the century I d.C.
also we ourselves how define the platitude .
&quot; the problem is that already has defined and discussed of very various ways &quot; , that John D. fawn , Professor of fawn of the University of York in fawn , Canada .
after at the research premises and raise the idea to a group of discussion have 100 people , the Professor fawn and their colleagues defined the platitude as the experience of &quot; desired , but not power , participate in a activity that you full &quot; .
says that the difference between the platitude and the apathy is that the person not ago something but to do .
out that with the apathy not there the wish of to something .
the experience main the platitude , says , is &quot; the at the process of attention , associated to a under state of mind and to a that of that the time is slowly &quot; .
the platitude can sound turmoil be to the depression .
however , the Professor fawn says that , although they be related , the people that are inhuman tend to see the problem as a question the environment or the world , while that the people that are depressed they that the problem what have them .
to sometimes we that we boring , when what that we is in reality is that we problems for our .
in their study &quot; the fawn fawn : fawn fawn in fawn of fawn &quot; , published in the edition of September of the magazine fawn as fawn Meat , the Professor fawn and their colleagues were to a experiment previous in the that the participants fawn a tape of a person that surplus the Article of a magazine .
some groups heed in the room neighbouring a programme of television to all volume that not bore no relationship , other what heed with the volume under , of way that hardly was justifiable , while that the third group not listened the audio in no time .
the group that listened the programme with the volume under was more platitude that the other two groups ; them cost focus , but not were insurance of what and what fawn the platitude .
&quot; when fawn fawn in a task difficult or interesting , the at of the attention can to the platitude &quot; , pressed Mark J. fawn , Professor of fawn of the University of fawn , in fawn , and one of the authors the study .
&quot; another on , when with doing something boring , as detect parts unprepared in a line of manufacture , a music that you fawn you can help to not fawn &quot; .
&quot; of fact , currently we that ! or to fawn , actions that to often are as sign of platitude , can in reality help to combat , already that do that that person is physically more vigilant &quot; .
&quot; the research shown that those children to the that them allows ! about more and observation more information that those to the that them forced to be static &quot; , says the Professor fawn .
all we what that is dull in some time : the delay of a air , a speaker spin , a film especially dismally .
but some people have more trend to dull that other .
for help to fawn , some researchers proceeded in the years 80 a &quot; at of trend the platitude &quot; .
the at includes issues as &quot; many of the things that have that to are repetitive and fawn &quot; and &quot; there many things that I interested that not have time of do all &quot; .
instigation fawn , Professor of fawn of the University of West Florida , says that , being these regional , the researchers have discovered that the boys have more trend to dull more to often that the girls , and specifically need more stipulation external and more diverse .
but , in general , the adolescents are a kind of group that boring with quite easily .
in 1991 , fawn fawn , Professor of development human and Community of the University of Illinois , was to out a experiment in the that disposal in contact with 400 adolescents and with their parents between seven and eight sometimes the day by a search .
found that the 32 cent of the adolescents said that fawn while was in the school or doing the duties , while that the 23 cent said that fawn when not was in the school .
another on , the 3 cent of the parents were that fawn .
the Professor fawn said that not was if the rates of platitude current , 21 years after , would with or lower .
but said that what that was was that &quot; the adolescence is a period in the that the platitude high their correctness more high &quot; , in great part because to that therefore to the children as to the adolescents not them a great control on what that want to .
so that , back to my question the principle : is good dull ?
to sometimes not what is , already that , taken the extreme , can to that we exposing to risks physical absurd , as to betting or we in the consumption of substances as method for combat , such and as shown the research .
another on , many scholarship and writers speak of the connection between the platitude and the creativity , according says the Professor fawn , that has state at this question for more of two decades .
&quot; the platitude is the way that has the which of word that we be doing other thing &quot; , says paranoid fawn , Professor of fawn of the University of new York .
but the which not always know what is what more appropriate .
if with boring and you that energy for play the fawn or cooking , that you satisfy .
but if you the television , is possible that you who to short term , but not to long term .
&quot; so that , if your son is boring and you Give a iPad , is possible that already not fawn , but not will learned to hands same or to fawn &quot; , says the Professor fawn .
and &quot; that capacity of fawn applies to other situations &quot; , out .
your son not only learns to hands only , but that learns to unchecked better in other areas .
not i that really want i the platitude .
but not should be too critical with he .
our aim should be , more well , the of be expressing paragraphs the rumour constant of the activities and the technologies .
the Professor fawn is of agreement .
&quot; to our way of see , need fawn more , but the platitude is a wish too distressing and disturbing as for linked with something that deserves the it &quot; , says .
out that what that the people really search is a way of switch and of enjoy of a time died .
&quot; in a environment in the that we constantly fawn &quot; , says , &quot; is difficult find forms of focus our attention when the noise by &quot; .
mistreated : book of instructions for the new law on the consumption of fawn
fawn fawn , student of 19 years in a Institute Community and came the Asia of mistreated , faces to a process criminal something that soon will legal in all the state : the possession of a stones of marijuana and a pipe that his for fawn .
fawn says that a day of September , he and some friends fawn fawn , in the plains urgently to the border of Kansas , when the stopped the police .
the police found marijuana in the car and a time after fawn received a summons legal possession of drugs and articles related ( crimes age that threat every one a fined of 100 dollars Americans ) in the that you Detectives of the date the trial .
&quot; we are as to criminal &quot; , says fawn .
and what are ?
in the weeks of uncertainty following to the vote that had place in mistreated for the legalisation of the prison of small quantities of marijuana for use hand , the answer in hundreds of causes age prison of drugs on least of the law that of the location .
hundreds of crimes age possession of marijuana are overwritten therefore here as in the state of Washington , where adopted a measure similar .
the departments of police have longer of it charges against the over of 21 years possession to small at , that will legally a time the law has entered in force in the next weeks .
but the tax of districts more Conservatives of mistreated have committed to to forward with the cases open possession of marijuana and still are quote to people .
the same time , several cities , since the suburbs of Denver to the mountains Western , are voting for prevent that open shops of marijuana , you recently , in their communities .
&quot; all this is changing so quickly that not know what will what next &quot; , said Daniel J. fawn , head of police in fawn , fair the this of Denver .
who are of the there in the state of Washington also are our around the issue .
and are for advice for establish a system of licences of production , manufacture , distribution and sale ; all this before of that it the date limit , the 1 of December of 2013 .
say that , for well or for , mistreated is front of the majority of the States in as to the regulation the use of the marijuana , first with for fawn and now for use hand .
&quot; mistreated at of a market more regulated , so that will a good on &quot; , says Mr E. Smith , spokesman of the Commission of control the alcohol the state of Washington .
but the Sr. Smith accepts that any place or system only can to suggestions on what that could work .
&quot; not there a real precedent that we as of model &quot; , says .
the law of Washington , which I-502 , will in force the 6 of December , what that is also a year for the which fawn between two waters , already that the system of licences in that state still not will , but the possession will legal .
also , there some issues suffocation sensitive that must resolved for that period , as the way of keep a balance between the demand the state of offer a &quot; access appropriate &quot; to the marijuana authoritative and their ban of to business of cannabis in a radio than to 300 metres of schools , parks , areas of at children or centres children .
&quot; in no place will more difficult fawn a business of cannabis for that in the areas urban , especially in the area city of Seattle &quot; , says Ben fawn , spokesman the centre for the cannabis legal , a group of research created recently .
the 21 of November , fawn , the head of police of fawn , sent a email electronic to their players of police in the that them Detectives of that the tax of the city commodities of prevail actions judicial one very possession of marijuana to people over of 21 years and of that the police commodities of it charges against these crimes &quot; with effect immediately &quot; .
the head of police fawn said that them away of to to the regulation of the city that regulates the as of marijuana with for therapeutic and that begrudgers pursued to traffickers and sellers of drugs .
in the county of fawn , in the North of mistreated , the tax the district , Ken fawn , represents a vision more strict .
after the vote , was that their office solitary pursued the cases of possession of marijuana , mainly for pressure to the consumers and that have to receive treatment .
currently , 119 people face to charges possession of 56 grammes or least of marijuana , although many of them have other charges .
&quot; our office has the duty of prevail actions judicial against those one that in the time in that there were crime &quot; , said the Sr. fawn in a statement .
the answer has been difficult even in places as the county rural of table , where the voters rejected the initiative on the legalisation of the marijuana .
the police of Cardiff fawn , the greater city the county , already not quotation to adults possession of small quantities .
fawn fawn , tax the district the county , supported this decision , but also decided not presented none of the cases outstanding possession .
&quot; not i that is losing the time the to doing to the law to that this changes &quot; , said .
to despite of that the 55 cent of the voters supported the measure , never was that to the consumption of marijuana for use hand the within the government and the system legal outside to be easy .
the reactions at that arise all the state are of clear a marked ambivalence between the officials regard the great experiment using in this state .
&quot; is of a barrier cultural with the tax the district &quot; , says are fawn , a lawyer of Denver that represents to the accused possession of marijuana and that is spokesman local of the organisation national for the reform of the law on the marijuana .
&quot; have last therefore time moment to people to the courts that , in reality , still not can accept that be legal &quot; , said .
the be the first States that they the quantities small of marijuana of the same way that if outside alcohol , mistreated and Washington prepare for become in the cases of test to level national in as to the legalisation of drugs .
while lawyers and officials the state have with a new border of sales legal , also expect promised receive indications the government Federal , that still for the consideration of the sale and the as of marijuana as crimes federal .
the defenders of the legalisation of the marijuana have the hope of that the department of justice i .
to despite of that have been some leading arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for for therapeutic , the government Federal has allowed in their majority that there business of sale of marijuana with these for in mistreated , Washington and 16 States more .
&quot; although is likely that the players integrates not fawn doors from for boxes a exchange of drugs small , probably will averse to allow the functioning of shops regulated the state for the sale of marijuana for use hand , one in the new law &quot; , said fawn A. fawn , a fawn of policy integrates of the administration of Obama .
several cities of mistreated not expect to that act the authorities federal .
even before the day of the elections , some governments local number moratoriums on any shop new of marijuana , to despite of that will around of a year before of that who of them can open .
the week last , the city Western of fawn adopted a ban of six months and is likely that the I the week that next .
&quot; not we put in a situation in the that coexist to someone and then we a serious problem to level Federal &quot; , he approaching Nicholson , Member the City .
&quot; our Community voted in against of this amendment .
we at to favour of what that voted the Community with to vote to favour of what that voted the state . &quot;
arise many questions the regard .
fawn fawn : &quot; I fawn to down of Oxford be a hunted &quot;
not strikes to the it their points of view only fawn
not remember no time in my life in the that not has state boggles in to a place in the University of Oxford .
therefore my father as my brother greater had state in the that I supposed was the better place the world for learn , a symposium Greek of the was contemporary that employee the two pillars of the civilisation : the thinking free and the tolerance .
however , to the two weeks of should my place in the fawn College to end of the years 80 for welcome the career of history , already had fact the packed , what that triggered the first scandal of my life .
my father crumbled and retraced to our .
my friends were there .
the newspaper the fawn fawn said that I had abandoned because not fawn that some colleagues of University maintained relations sexual in the room of the on .
the A. N. Wilson announced that I had gone because I compelled to drinking in fawn fawn .
the truth was least funny .
fawn of there .
, fawn , because had state put to a systematic harassment and intimidation .
not because to my fawn name , not the fact of that from of a school private .
I fawn a only reason , that in the cradle of the conciliation illustration was something to and barbaric : my father , the Patriarch fawn fawn , was a striking advisory of Margaret Thatcher and I supported the party Conservative .
perhaps ask to what next that now .
well , several reports show that a new generation of students of centre right is suffering a persecution similar .
the hatred institutionalised and growing towards the students the party Conservative is such in Oxford that , the week last , a group of them called the same level of equality of rights that have the homosexuals , the disabled and the minorities ethnic .
Member Conservatives of the fawn ( grouping of students of degree ) the corpus fawn College claim that are &quot; to often seriously paragraphs , personally attacked and treaties as people not objected &quot; their ideas policies .
want create a since in the Committee of equality of opportunities of their school university for ensure of power express their views freely .
their situation not was proliferation a recent documentary of the BBC2 called &quot; Wonderland : Young , fawn and as the fawn &quot; ( the paradise : young , it and of right ) on the policy of the students and that presented to the fawn as fawn and BNP .
fawn the student of master fawn fawn , fawn of the partnership the party Conservative of the University of Oxford ( fawn ) , in a Rolls-Royce , caps a suit silver and a produce with the fawn of silver .
in other universities , the students Conservatives say that them is as &quot; them of Turkish &quot; the introduction of rates of plate more higher .
fawn Black , of 20 years and of of the partnership the party Conservative of the University of damage , declared in a newspaper nature that &quot; there a growing trend of left in the universities .
the people moderating that we as the fawn club not so even fawn &quot; .
fawn Shaw , of 21 years and student of history in corpus fawn that presented the motion for a greater protection , says that this environment is &quot; you &quot; , while that fawn fawn , of 19 years and President elected of the fawn , says that the attitude of the Member of the fawn towards the people that are of centre right has worsened .
&quot; this is a threat for the environment of debate intellectual , so as for the welfare of the Member &quot; , says .
for my first weeks in Oxford was more single that the a .
i in the University in September of 1986 , was a young of 18 years turmoil timid .
the hatred towards the party Conservative was in their point more high .
the year previous , the University had voted can to Margaret Thatcher , former fawn , a title &quot; Szczeciń cause &quot; after the cuts in the funding of the education higher .
the environment would fact horrifying of appalling to any Stalinist .
already for the first days of the week of welcome to the new it , when the new students know and know to the professors , received a shows of the bitterness that I than .
thoroughly that the professors not only the the view blind to the fawn that was of the it Conservatives , but that involved in she of good earns .
the policy of the strike of the miners , the privatisation and the opposition the government to the sanctions against the Apartheid in Africa came to the rooms of wood the seminar .
the first that I be speak the English texts French the century centuries and I not was ready for what that wine to continuation .
&quot; fawn fawn &quot; , said the professor fawn fawn ( already died ) , &quot; favour , translates the first paragraph &quot; .
not realised not a .
fawn , a man fawn with a face that seemed mass of fawn , was well how who bad fawn .
&quot; is that the fawn refuse to learn French or is that , simply , are thinks ? &quot; , asked .
the other it laughed .
I compared the eyes of the tears that was of contain .
&quot; you suggest that will to classes of French in their time free , always and when not is too occupied as people &quot; , fawn fawn .
returned to my room as a soul in it .
that night I sat single to the time of the dinner in the University ; then felt a this straight in the on .
was a student of English of second year called James that presented as Member of the fawn .
&quot; know who you &quot; , I said politely .
&quot; I fear that so is as is the thing .
mouths with who that be suspect of be hunted .
for me is very complicated , but know that your father is have to Margaret Thatcher , so that for you will still worst .
many fawn would newcomers fawn be Labour &quot; .
more forward , in a lunches local , tried Lidón hide .
stressed in that not was of agreement with all what that said the Sra. Thatcher .
that trick s pointless .
a student of first year of philosophy , policies and economy that , paradoxically , had examined in fawn , said : &quot; you daughter of a pig fascist .
with would &quot; .
other students adopted that fawn .
I became in the laundry fawn .
&quot; how have relations sexual the fawn ? &quot; , asked one .
&quot; are a him the one the another , not ? &quot;
I felt of the same way that should have sense the homosexuals before of the law liberal of the years 60 .
could some day to a life normal in Oxford ?
I be forced to be with people that thought as I only after the fawn ?
would that plenty Labour and suppressed my trends natural ?
the three years that I were were as a purgatory of condemnation and isolation .
the only professor openly hunted was fawn Sexual , Professor of history contemporary aimed to my school university .
you fawn be not only the party Conservative , but also advisory of Thatcher in policy foreign and a of the people that you go their speeches .
hardly was there .
fawn the place that what he parochial and it and their wet to the vision marxista-determinista of the history .
in 1997 accepted a chair in the University of fawn , in Ankara , Turkey .
&quot; here not you to be happy &quot; , I said .
I to visit daily of Oxford to home of my parents in London , finding refuge in my family and friends of mentality city more open .
you I to my father that hated Oxford and what .
not I believed .
when he long there in the years 40 , deleting all the points of view political .
&quot; but if is the better place the world &quot; , said with sadness .
&quot; them never would that , not there between my dear needlestick of dream .
to my friends Communist always had a attitude whiter &quot; .
their fawn eyes they to fawn .
&quot; fawn other opportunity .
am sure of that what have fact only for fawn .
I Tipperary the heart if what fawn . &quot;
structural of many travel to London , my resistance emotional was deteriorating .
a friend mine , that also supported the party Conservative , had succumbed to the pressure and had renounced to their cultures .
the week next , for a seminar in the that another professor of history had hinted , about completely in seriously , that I was a &quot; enemy the people &quot; , decided to what same .
Red of shame within , fawn that my parents I had &quot; laundering the which &quot; and them discovered &quot; old broke &quot; .
the the for little time .
was my father who it the last coffin in the coffin of my career university in Oxford .
at then my father illiterate two fawn week in the press of Murdoch .
my door was closed with key .
I was within fawn of fear and , automatic five minutes , my equates fawn .
when were i the GDR and took the first train to London .
never returned .
perhaps I fawn weak fawn .
but no person of 18 years should be put to such level of intimidation and hostility in a institution amusing .
what that is still more tragic is that was Oxford , that not only has have to 14 first ministers the party Conservative but that , to day of today , behind after a ensure nothing vilnius of equality and freedom of thinking .
&quot; Valentino prefer the elegance to the boost &quot;
with reason of the shows &quot; Valentino : master of the remnant &quot; , that has Decade this week in London , fawn about with fawn fawn , fawn Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous fawn the leather fawn

am a husband murdering , you my wife fawn , ! do with our duty civic and we life fawn
can appear be that these idly are part of a announcement of tablets of fawn , but to despite of that - or perhaps because to that - the webstreaming the fawn in YouTube in Singapore to principles of this year .
the sentences are part of a aspects that used no local as &quot; we to to a fawn ( fawn ) in the oven &quot; for laughing of the rate of birth of Singapore .
the company of advertising that was the webstreaming , fawn , thailand the hope of that with the announcement forgetting draw the attention on the problem of a way funny .
their director creative , fawn Hamilton , says that wanted use the power of the music for that the people ! with &quot; their duty national &quot; .
this is something purely of Internet , so that had that do fun and funny .
is the greater problem in this country .
we the worst the world in fawn to us ourselves , so that we that this was a issue that we that address .
knew that the government had tried many things , as launch perfumes with fawn or organise fawn of from spiralling ( speed-dating ) .
many of these ideas can have been creative , but not necessarily worked .
so that we , what not we what more creative possible for right this problem , that is fawn a aspects ?
1,2 fawn
the that not what the so to the this is the government of Singapore .
spent fawn $ 1.300 the year in policies for encourage to the citizens to have more children .
a package the government for marriages and parents make to 15.000 dollars child , or the licences leave and spread profits tax .
but all this has had little effect .
Singapore is a city state rich and of high technology in the Asia of Asia , also known the track of their leaders and their needed controls social .
the rate of birth of Singapore , of agreement with their division national of population , at currently in 1,2 children woman .
the last time that was above of 2 -conocida as rate of reposición- was in 1976 .
so that what the fawn not have more children ?
so fawn fawn , there of policies of marriage and family of the division national of population , says that is because to a &quot; better education &quot; and &quot; a range more wider of opportunities of career &quot; .
&quot; that you has allowed to the people have of a range more wider of options in terms of objectives of life and priorities , more beyond of marriage and be a family &quot; , it .
these changes in the rules social have contributed the increase of the fawn , and to delay the marriage and the births , what that as result a in of the rate of birth in Singapore .
while therefore , a policy of immigration EU is to increase drastically the immigration for to with to the in of the population has created umbrage between the population local .
in Singapore there websites website where rife the xenophobia hardly disguised against many new immigrants , in particular the Chinese , to the that critics keep the wages Netherlands and not integrated .
the increase of the immigration also is seen as a of the reasons the that the year last the party of government of Singapore experienced their worst result electoral since the independence .
since the elections has there a attempt of right the problem , with the quotas and taxes more higher for the workers foreign .
consequences fawn
while that the fall in the rate of birth has effects known in the growth economic of a nation , the income tax , the costs health and the policies of immigration , the example of Singapore also is taking some consequences some .
the government is that not built many houses small .
example , has started to affect the sector estate .
the authority of development urban has last to control the number of over small , known as &quot; box of shoes &quot; , that they build in certain areas of the city .
these over have land of 46 metres square and have had a success of sales .
however , there concern of that they promote a lifestyle of life of fawn and fawn to the developers that want build houses large , family .
but fawn My Soon , director general of the company buildings the fawn , says that their &quot; boxes of shoes &quot; sold a more quickly that the units more large .
are more popular , in the sense of that the units exhausted days , even weeks , more quickly that the units of greater size .
this ago that be a better for our flow of box .
however , accepts that the new rules are guidelines more clear for the developers , to the that before them disposal snags if wanted offer too units small in a project .
too fawn
Singapore is a city state .
if well these new rules can be a step towards the increase of the rate of birth national , the about with the fawn that working in the district financial the centre existence that not will to have a effect .
&quot; the people is very stressed , the houses are sides and also what is the education , what that many people what are they &quot; , says a young executive .
other people can have children .
&quot; but for me is important have with my own money and time &quot; , says another young of a 20 years .
men and women mention their career , the stress and the costs of the properties and of the education as the for that them from have children .
so that , a that the government involved of force to their citizens to have children , when is of to babies , the fawn are who have the last word .

the President Ecuadorean was , also , to favour of the up of the organisation of States Americans ( AEO ) under the premise of down the influence of the States Continental and have in account to the that have signed the Pact of St José on the rights human .
the that are chair never themselves to nothing and , in change , us the fawn what arrangement all .
&quot; is incomprehensible that the Commission which of rights human is in Washington under the funding of States United &quot; , said in referring the asylum political given Ecuador the founder of WikiLeaks , Julian Assange .
Correa was that not is fawn of that decision because with this not has betrayed their principles , but that has respected their &quot; profound values democratic and of rights human &quot; .
But that , in their time , &quot; had OLAF arrests of that Assange outside extradited to a third country and not it their process &quot; .
listening , also , to the justice Swedish observance that able in their territory the interrogation a alleged crime sexual when &quot; the own legislation Swedish allows obliged by video , that could to since the Embassy of Ecuador in London &quot; .
Correa said that there the risk of that deteriorate the health physical and mental of Assange .
&quot; not I about with he since that is in our Embassy , but the her I informed that had a small problem allegedly , nothing serious &quot; , said the event Ecuadorean .
what that there is the danger of that deteriorate their health physical and mental be he in a space small power to exercises the air free .
&quot; that complicates the health of any person &quot; , But .
Correa pointed that the solution the asylum orientates to Assange since June in the Embassy fawn in London , by the granting of a fawn that you to travel to Ecuador , is in hands of great Britain , Sweden and the authorities legal European and it that has there discussions with London in search of a solution the fawn the founder of WikiLeaks .
us not negotiate with rights human , that word not the we in this case , but has there permanent discussions .
&quot; the solution of this problem is in hands of great Britain , Sweden and of the authorities legal European because the lawyer of Assange , fawn Baltasar , is doing a series of procedures in different bodies European &quot; , mentioned .
and opinion that &quot; if great Britain morning the pass this has &quot; .
and if Sweden , as perfectly what allows their legislation and as has fact in other cases , fawn the mr Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London or what fawn to Skype morning same has this problem .
Correa availed for failure as a Ombudsman of the freedom of press and fawn that what that not does is &quot; the mediocrity , the bad faith and the lie , that weaken the freedom of expression &quot; .
&quot; the over enemies of the freedom of press not we the political villains and wicked but the bad journalists in role the profit , the blackmail and the extortion &quot; , said .
in that aspect welcomed that already not are these journalists &quot; not the bankers not the countries hegemonic and middle the that dominated to Ecuador &quot; , and forward that of be his &quot; fawn in the revolution for continue the way and the direction right &quot; .
Correa also supported the decision of keep the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur the least to their next elections , the further that the Agency &quot; must be firm and not tolerate the opportunism and the fawn fraught of legality &quot; because in reality &quot; shall the legitimacy of the democracy fawn &quot; .
the President Ecuadorean was , also , &quot; perfectly relevant &quot; the wish of their counterpart stock , Juan Manuel holy , of negotiate now with Nicaragua the limits seaports between both countries after the failure of the Court international of justice of the has , that impartiality to the sovereignty maritime fawn .
the time not by that failure .
is a problem between a country facilitates and one fawn .
the conflicts are inevitable , but must be overcome the will of moving together .
there that them of way wider for resolved and to forward .
also employee in a good conclusion the dispute limits seaports that are in the same Court Peru and Chile and opinion that &quot; is right for America Latin to bodies international if the two countries themselves to accept failure hard that be &quot; .
in reference to the possibility that present as candidate in the next elections presidential in Ecuador for to a third mandate running pointed that is that possibility &quot; with a optimism and joy , although to sometimes is quite hard &quot; .

deaths AIDS today are cause of detection fawn
fawn had 21 years of age when you anticipated the result of the test : AIDS positive .
&quot; was as if I out a bomb &quot; , as the recap the time the announcement , that the doctor he to &quot; more fawn &quot; , success clear .
the child what kept to their family .
decided done office only of their disease and started to needs on she ; with such as that already fawn their understand 43 .
is , doubt , one of the patients more old of the unit of HIV the hospital civil of Guadalajara ( fawn ) , to the that came in 1994 after of several battles .
fawn lives with the virus of the line human ( HIV ) since ago 22 years , something difficult of imagine to principles of the 90 , when had many doubt , few options of treatment and more stigma .
then , to the director of a clinic the fawn blackout fawn of he &quot; because fawn a off &quot; .
then , have AIDS was synonymous of death .
now is possible survive to this syndrome and do with quality of life .
however , ignorant of their disease , still many people they when the virus already has caused havoc , &quot; reached &quot; their system immune and are victims of infections opportunistic .
to 31 years of the emergence the AIDS in the world , the least of the first cases reported , &quot; the great achievement means in this time that the fawn of a patient that as treatment in way have and the fawn of the population general , is exactly as &quot; , pressed the head of the unit of HIV the fawn , fawn fawn fawn , after referring that this information was Therefore in April of this year in a publication scientific fawn .
fawn and expert in HIV / AIDS , fawn fawn a that since the year 2008 , the scientists had completed that the AIDS not was a ruling fatal , but the years of survival and the quality of life on the degree of fawn the system immune that have the patients the to the diagnosis , with better expectation for who not are users of drugs : of to 30 years with a fawn of 200 CD4 and of 50 years , when our 500 CD4 .
in words simple , what previous means that who a the diagnosis of HIV positive to the 25 years of age , under these terms &quot; while it in control will live problems to the 75 years &quot; , he the interviewed .
for fawn this progress , is remember that the hope of life of the Mexican today is of 76 years in average .
if well the mortality has down significantly in the last years , in the case of Mexico , the number of people that die of AIDS struggle of 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 ( fawn annual of UNAIDS ) , also is true that since the emergence the AIDS , 60 cent of the patients in the basis of data national have died .
only in fawn 255 people died in 2011 , and will 187 deaths to May of this year ; not however will that there access universal to the drugs opportunistic since 2005 .
- what still they deaths ?
- to me I seems that the problem not is of access to treatment .
so what fawn , so we has happened in our hospital .
the least in the last 12 years not we had fawn of medicine the problem is that the patients they very advanced because not their state of infection , or be , in stages late of the disease .
was a fact no : &quot; nine of every ten patients they when already have any infection offence what that has that to for have a greater impact on the mortality global , is to verdicts more fawn and , what therefore , have that offer evidence of detection of way mass , to all the people that what overnight &quot; .
in their proposal line specialists and officials the Council state of prevention the AIDS in fawn ( fawn ) , also the own patients , as fawn , who out to done the test to a laboratory particular , only drove because what had fact a friend and , despite to their short age , already was in stage of AIDS and even fawn fawn of fawn , a by cancerous that is a of the complications common .

that do the test , if had risk , that between more soon know if are HIV positive , is better and if already have the diagnosis , that learn that can live as any person , being responsible .
that , their message , sums the motto of battle the AIDS this 2012 .
