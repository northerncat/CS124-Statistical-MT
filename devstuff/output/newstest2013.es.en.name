a strategy writings for way the be of writings
the leaders Republicans of their policy for the need of fight against the fraud electoral .
now well , the centre writings as this last a myth and that that the fraud electoral is less among in the Member United that the number of people that die to cause of the fall of a glimmer .
of fact , the lawyers Republicans not have found more that 300 cases of fraud electoral in the Member United in ten years .
a it is certain and these new provisions will adversely to the rate of participation .
in that sense , these measures writings in part the system democratic American .
the contrary of what that happens in Canada , the Member Americans are responsible of the organisation of the elections federal in the Member United .
and in that same line a majority of the governments Americans us , to from of 2009 , new laws that result the process of actually or of vote .
this a has have after the elections of November of 2010 , that were the increase of 675 new representatives Republicans in 26 Member .
in result , for the year 2011 was 180 projects of law that rules the exercise the right of vote in 41 Member .
the new laws election need that the voters should a document of identity with a picture , also of a proof of from American .
for other part , these laws get the periods of vote earlier , writings the right to join as involved in the day the that and resolutions their right the vote to the citizens with criminal criminal .
before of the elections of 2006 , no state American requirements that the voters us a document of identity with picture .
the state of writings was the first in writings .
the Court Supreme of the Member United confirmed in 2008 the being of the law of writings .
for this , the authorities Republican lies to extend that practice to other Member .
in the last years these authorities have supported projects of law in 34 Member for force to the voters to present a document of identity with picture .
is important have in account that , the contrary of what that is in Quebec , the citizens Americans not do of a document of identity universal , as the card of the security social .
of fact , a 11 % of the citizens Americans , is say , 21 million of people in age of vote , not have with no document of identity with picture has for a Agency government of their state .
for another side , five million of new voters in 2012 lack of a document of identity with these characteristics .
but , to often , the it the document of identity required costs more of hundred USD .
with what which , the new restrictions affect of way much to the young , the minorities and the people with income Netherlands .
in effect , a 25 % of writings , a 15 % of people that earn less of 35.000 USD the year , a 18 % of the citizens of more of 65 years and a 20 % of the voters of between 18 and 29 years not have with a document of identity with picture .
and still there more .
in many Member the students , the voters that more vote to the candidates Democrats , not can use the document of identity with picture has for their institution .
for other part , these same Member individuals to the States of the clubs of fishing or of a that often vote to the parties Republicans to use the documents issued for these clubs .
before of 2004 no state requirements the proof of from for vote .
snow was the first state in present this requirement .
since 2011 , a dozen of Member has adopted laws that need that the voters they that are citizens Americans .
these measures are , clearly , limit the vote writings .
seems be that two of every three voters writings support the party democratic .
for another side , the legislators Republicans they in 2011 certain laws that writings the actually of voters the same day the that in eight Member .
also , constrained the right of the people and the groups to create a service of aid to the voters that want join .
these restrictions have consequences .
for example , in the elections general of 2004 , the campaigns of actually of the voters contributed the registration of around of 10 million of citizens .
the measures taken since 2009 failed that the rate of actually of new voters be in 2010 in compared with the year 2006 .
also , the legislators Republicans adopted laws in other five Member that bill the reduction the period of vote for brought .
for example , in the elections of 2008 in Florida , a 33 % of the voters that voted for brought were writings , while that these last not represented more that a 13 % of the voters the state .
in the case of the writings was exactly what same .
these not represent more that a 11 % of the voters , what that is to a 24 % of the citizens that vote for brought .
without embargo , the are , that represent a 76 % the electorate , not represent more that the 46 % of the citizens that vote for brought .
for of , the legislators Democrats and their supporters have are would to the adoption of laws that party' the registration of voters .
in this sense , the real Democrats have blocked several projects of law .
the Ministry fiscal of the Member United intervened for suspending the laws more vexed .
could , in part , limit the damage .
for example , so only 16 of 34 Member adopted the law that requirements the presentation of a document of identity with picture .
without embargo , is undeniable that the new rules taken writings the exercise the right to vote in 2012 .
the critical Democrats an the are partisan of the laws that have voted , already that is clear that with them is influence in the results of 2012 in the Member key .
a report the centre writings of 2011 shows that the Member that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes necessary in the school electoral for achieve the Presidency .
is too soon for say with this if these amendments legislative to at of system electoral will a impact significant in the results of the elections presidential of 2012 .
a it is certain and these new provisions will adversely to the rate of participation .
in this sense , the measures writings in part the system democratic American .
detection the cancer of prostate and done the test or not states ?
in effect , the test of such there , in times , results writings , with they results negative or even they results positive , after the that decided to for medical so .
is a reason more that enough for to doubt to the men , already provide of for , on if should done or not the tests of detection .
done the test or not ?
we asked Council to two specialists .
in the studies made in the Member United was a great rate of transmitted between the groups of shows , for what that is difficult interpret these data and to recommendations firm .
for their part , the study European was certain difference of mortality between the patients that had made the detection and the that not .
the study , with a monitoring to the 12 years , showed also that there between the 30 and the 40 % of for of higher modern if not has made the test of detection .
i , for and , the test to from of the 50 years , or to from of the 40 years if your father has suffered cancer of prostate .
the men of origin writings have a rate of risk more high .
the key is take a good decision a time been the cancer .
there cancers including and other cancers that are writings .
is truly necessary achieve that the patient international the degree of risk of their cancer . must offer all the options possible and not necessarily treat the cancers of prostate that not informed against the life to long the , in whose case must have more well for a surveillance active of the disease .
today in day many men to the that they has been a cancer not are treated , since that said cancer not is aggressive or by a risk for their life .
in their place , they we a surveillance active of the disease and , if this made , they we a treatment .
writings every time with more often criteria precise for decide who should or not be Treaty .
i that will the test in any case .
but is important that talk with their doctor for determining if must done the test or not .
writings has created , in cooperation with the society international of writings , a tool that to assess the cons and the cons the test of such .
can shuffle this document ( for the at only in English , but will spending within of little ) in the next direction and writings and / / ca.movember.com / writings / mens-health / prostate-cancer-screening
prevent the writings
not , not there a everybody miracle for prevent the cancer .
to despite of the progress of the research , the adoption of habits of life particularly still being the better way of reduce the risks of would the disease .
believe that if all the world writings well and writings what enough , could prevent a 30 % of the cancers .
&quot; if no natural , that rate proposals , the less , the 50 % &quot; , highlights Sainjon writings , spokesman of the society people against the cancer .
in change , measure that around the 10 % of the cancers are writings .
many other still being totally unaccountable .
for the society people against the cancer , the fight against the a still being a priority to despite of the in the number of smoking .
the tobacco is such with the 85 % of the cases the cancer of lung .
is , also , a factor of risk for other types of cancers .
it very the health of the people .
&quot; today for today , still there 1,5 million of smoking in Quebec &quot; , declared the spokesman Sainjon writings .
a this off and 10 years after of to of smoking , the risk of die of cancer reduces to the half .
the writings
the writings and the obesity help also the emergence of the disease , according the writings .
cumbersome the risks of cancer of breast , of breast and of rectal , of writings , of writings and of human .
&quot; the research show that the practice regulate of activity physical for all the life protects against the cancer of breast &quot; , add .
the writings
the Atomic recommends , also , limit the consumption of Trieste red .
in large quantities , they career the risks of would a cancer cervical .
the products of writings also must avoided .
the preservation of the meat for their writings , extent or herrings can to the training of substances carcinogenic .
&quot; can damaging the cell the Atomic and a the development the cancer &quot; , we legal .
the writings
in the last years , several scientists have i the links between the complex how and the cancer .
without embargo , for the at their research not are Mrs .
writings the writings , the studies about of the vaccinations and are antithetical .
while that in one of they error a in of the risks of cancer of prostate , in another what that observed was , more well , a increase .
the effect of the vaccinations one in the cancer not has been determining with clearly .
for other part , M. writings by in the importance of about on the concerns and the criminal family of every one with their doctor .
&quot; to the test of detection not leads cancer . &quot;
the writings of writings in writings
the announcement the likely discovery the writings of writings 'no' a great commotion the summer last , and with reason .
believes , in effect , that this writings is is the mechanism for of the mass of all what that there in the it , nothing more and nothing less .
and what that is more , is of the writings whose existence predicted the model standard and our better or &quot; less bad &quot; explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the on , that still not has been levels writings .
but for the that not is totally clear that on of writings .
we without place to doubt that there a new writings and that seems much the writings of writings predicted for the model standard .
also , new data writings this week in a important Congress of physical fact in Kyoto seem confirmed that what is , although still are more data for be completely insurance .
of all ways , assume that is of writings , already that the for of right seem few . we of what is .
there , in this great world , a law extensive and see that means that two things not can found in the same place the same time .
not there way of infringing that rule and not what to too , because democratic worried damage .
although the physical of the particles be a world very complex , has shown that also in she there a law of these characteristics and the principle of exclusion of writings , that stipulates that two particles not can to the same space the same time if are in the same &quot; state writings &quot; ; a &quot; state &quot; that over , great way , of some of their characteristics .
the that eighteen the particles in two categories .
for a part we are with the good citizens leads writings , that as bien the principle of writings .
and for other are the writings , a how you of writings that not has respect for nothing , or the less not for this principle , what that means that can found in the same place and the same time .
according the page website the writings writings of the laboratories writings that , for true , is extraordinary , the writings into in two groups and the writings , of the that not we here , and the &quot; particles of force &quot; , for the that the large forces of the nature floodwaters and with the which the writings of writings would of any way writings .
these writings , it stress here , not are the writings writings that we believe .
of fact , if by read this chronic , is thank to a writings extremely writings and the writings or the &quot; writings of light &quot; that it as &quot; bringing &quot; of the force waves .
in effect , when a writings with a burden power accelerates or change of direction , &quot; writings &quot; the camp writings in that we environment ; a little as when we a stone to a like .
in this &quot; critical &quot; born a caused waves ( of the light , of the ultraviolet , of the composed , etc. ) , and this caused not is other it that a writings ; is say , one of the writings &quot; for of force &quot; .
camp more writings
happens what same with the writings of writings , with the difference of that is of another camp , the camp of writings , that needs be &quot; countryside &quot; for that this writings resulted .
now well , the camp of writings is it more stable that the camp writings . for legally ago lack to to renewable extremely one , a little as if like of a like celebrated in the that so only a macroeconomic writings could would for the area .
for this ago lack a immense while of particles as the of the Wide ( it the great writings of writings is a ring of 27 km of finland exports! ) for to such levels of energy .
the analogy with the camp writings is a new tool that is the relationship between the writings and the mass .
of fact , not all the particles or all the materials learned with the camp writings .
some , as the magnets , what they , but other not and a piece of role , for example , not will never for same next to the door of a keep .
and of the same way , not all the particles learned with the camp of writings and the that what they have a mass , while that the rest ( how the writings , for true ) , not the have .
now well , what &quot; can give &quot; all these research ? , question the madam writings .
for the science , this of for foods the validity the model standard ( writings ) , and to , also , that the that writings the differences between the remarks and the predictions the writings .
for their part , many want would that are , because the a difference could open a door to a &quot; new physical &quot; that writings certain holes the model .
this , there that it , has still enormous shortcomings , as that not proposes explanation any on to the patient's ( it writings exports! ) or to the on dark , that is around the 80 % of the on the it ( it another writings exports! ) .
but not we found such differences in the Wide to the at .
writings
the impact of these research in our day to day are difficult of predict , but not we that we let the say that not will no .
for that watch and to at of the years 60 , the pioneers the writings in the laboratories not writings in no the revolution that their work result .
writings the opposed scientific , but nothing more .
of fact , as already said the psychological writings writings , that worked in the laboratories writings , where invented the writings in 1960 , and that up the first writings an ( the first were writings ) in 1962 , the principle the writings was more well considered a &quot; apparatus of laboratory &quot; .
just ...
and also , the opposed can also proceed of all the implementing that surrounding to the research .
for example , the same writings writings up a writings of light in 1969 in the course of their research in on of writings .
to despite of that not was in no their intention original , this writings of now of &quot; eye &quot; for all the equipment digital the world , what that weakened the Nobel of physical in 2009 .
that not to say , for of , that the activities the writings want necessarily into our lives , but that never know ...
care palliative . the better way of die ... &#124; writings
in their Commission die in dignity , Quebec was recently the sensitive question the end of the life .
the debate must adopted soon while in a project of law .
now well , within of that an essential , still there much that to .
writings has tried see of close .
ago hardly weeks , the Sr. L. living only in their your of the writings .
the cancer of prostate that was destroying had given a breathing of two years .
&quot; i had given five years of life , but already wearing seven &quot; , tracing , fact a is , want in their bed in the centre of care palliative Victor-Gadbois of writings , to the that was the day previous .
&quot; but always is a shock , not we be prepared for this &quot; , continues .
the disease has caused havoc and a weakness huge that from go only the bathing and even are for only .
upper with to a writings lunch , accept writings that help to are .
her , comes even to writings , to about with the unknown that who she , bring medicines and offer a bathing .
the courage of the death ordinary .
&quot; my greater wish is that i writings the diarrhoea , is humiliating &quot; , if .
hours more afternoon , the team found be to that .
&quot; in the course of our lives wrong that a man ago writings of ordinary &quot; , tracing pierre writings , currently in the centre Victor-Gadbois .
return to their early , for certain people , is a it unacceptable .
&quot; that on of the capacity of the person for accept that social &quot; , relate .
because , according the opinion of the majority of the people that working in care palliative , the large at have place in the heart same of that social .
all the patients that entering in the centre of care palliative Victor-Gadbois from cancer .
have a things of life maximum of three months .
in that state , the team of advocated and nurses that they around already not offer the care &quot; writings &quot; .
the greater fear of the Sra. A. , of 89 years , is die &quot; aware and writings &quot; .
but the disease has fact be to their children .
&quot; have a good children &quot; , they .
&quot; already not i are more wishes in this life &quot; , says , before of accept that heart a writings for we to .
and expected , in the next days , a last visit of their son that live in Italy .
in Victor-Gadbois provides , with a group of who , the care the body and aid to the healthy .
are care palliative that they give when not can to nothing more .
for help to that their death be more writings .
in Quebec we with a bed of care palliative for every 11.700 inhabitants .
is very little , already that we that all will dying some day .
here , the life continues in the best conditions possible , is the Dra. writings writings , a of the writings the centre .
already be to level of comfort psychological , emotional or impoverishment .
the writings offer writings of mouth with you or writings , according the demand .
to the ordinary already not they control their rate of sugar .
the death way part of what travel .
yesterday for the night our a beer the Sr. Parliament , that died in the course of the night .
this tomorrow , their son end the beer to the feet the late .
&quot; we and to the patients as to their human ones &quot; , tracing writings writings , there of the care .
in the centre Victor-Gadbois the days discussions without be never equal .
the side of a man of 94 years that writings their last meeting family in the so , well categorized between their writings while all they to their health , a young of 36 years dies of way tragic , surrounded for their parents , their woman and their two children , after he tried all for survive .
&quot; since ago six months , always there of three to five caged jobs for people under of 45 years worldwide of cancer &quot; , concerned the Dra. writings writings .
a 53 % of the patients that are admitted in the centre Victor-Gadboisarrivent is of their house and a 47 % the hospital .
problem the access to care writings
a 77 % of the European simply not has access to the care palliative , is say , to the care designed for can the suffering when a with comes to the phase at of their life , be in their home , in the hospital or in a centre of care .
and several bodies , as the centre Victor-Gadbois and the society of care palliative to home the couple writings , organized almost exclusively in the care of the patients with cancer .
is precisely that great omission on in the care health of Quebec what that ago that many advocated great in care palliative granting the adoption of a law that regulates the euthanasia and the suicide for .
since the month of October , a highlighted signed for NATO of the care palliative , as the Dr. Balfour writings and the Dr. Bernard writings , records for demonstrate their opposition to such initiative .
according the Dra. writings writings , the system health of Quebec not is what enough competent as for ensure that anyone have right to care palliative of quality before of that accept proceed with the euthanasia .
&quot; recently &quot; , tracing , &quot; I seen to a patient it 14 days in writings suffering large will without that has fact what necessary for writings .
fear that the patients should die only because not receive the care are &quot; .
and at , many much writings with their patients to the last day , to despite of the worst forecasts .
the hopes of survival of Flautre's Richard were already under minimum when for a treatment of rather exhausting .
&quot; when I to my writings that wanted stop the treatment , she i said that was great it that like to of fight &quot; , tracing .
&quot; without embargo , it she i had said that not had nothing more that to exports! &quot;
not there care writings
the Dra. writings believes that a 90 % of the people that illegitimate die thanking to their just that not they have speak in their demands a time they has in their headache thank to a team of care palliative .
but there that say that the care palliative not are absolutely writings in what that as the treatment the headache .
according writings writings , there of the care palliative to home of couple writings , the patients not provide to the treatments against the headache in a 8 % of the cases .
the end of the life , the doctors often resort to the sedating up , that of for sleeping the patient to the at of their illegal , already be of way occupational or of way permanent .
not we pretend that not we that part the suffering .
every time more , the disease not post is to have the possibility of have that sedating up .
the people that not are relieved say all what same and &quot; i i die &quot; .
but that not to say necessarily &quot; i the euthanasia &quot; , but &quot; i that i writings &quot; .
the also of this watched has been possible thank to a grants of journalism of the institutes of research of health of Canada .
repeat who of great it in writings
officials of the network road , employers the writings , despised of funds of parties political and specialists of the mafia Italian have , day after day , what that know of a enormous &quot; system &quot; , the that are part the industry of the construction , officials , political , unionists and apparently .
a &quot; industry &quot; that went too expensive to the taxpayers Quebec , on all in the years 1990 and 2000 .
&quot; is done how the system writings a time we writings to the large means &quot; , writings Jacques writings , Member in Quebec and former head of the police of Montreal .
he writings the outbreak the scandal in 2011 , that was possible thank to a research to fund on the misappropriation linked to contracts of roads in Quebec , that the first Minister liberal of that at , Jean writings , not had said: more that in delaying .
the &quot; report writings &quot; set a link direct between the industry , the funding illegal of the parties and the corruption between officials .
&quot; since the start of the research in 2010 , so only the Ministry of transport would great billion million of USD in contracts &quot; , analysing some of their a of stay with a part proportional .
the Commission writings &quot; already has fact fall to two mayors &quot; , they , while expected power to to &quot; demonstrate the devices existing behind of the individuals &quot; .
a unity permanent forms , created in 2011
the unity permanent forms , created in 2011 , applies also with their team of no , researchers and analysts the government .
this unity works also of the policemen of &quot; the also writings &quot; , that , since 2009 , have fact that the &quot; cartel the illegal &quot; of Montreal demand to the time of point contracts .
these last weeks , the unity has allowed the registration in series of the accusations for fraud and corruption against charges municipal as Frank writings and Richard writings , Mayor of a city of the outskirts .
the next of the list would Chad writings , that just of resign of their since of Mayor of laval , third city of Quebec .
suspicion that has writings repeated bribery to change of contracts public .
has accused formally to engineers of the network road of Montreal and to employers of origin Italian , as Tony writings and criminal writings .
this last has caused commotion the explain to the Commission the wrong the &quot; system &quot; of it of contracts public .
he same paid for three years a 3 % the value of the contracts investigation in Montreal to a intermediary linked to the mafia that running the money to dimension writings , the party the Mayor writings writings .
M. writings writings money to right and trade for the years 2000 , allowing more of 88.000 USD European ( a 68.000 EUR ) to parties provincial , on all to the Liberals in the power .
buried , also , have organised a laptops of funds illegal for the ex-viceprimera Minister liberal , writings writings .
the inflation the cost of the contracts of writings
in Montreal , the &quot; system &quot; of corruption came with efficiency .
Chad writings , writings of works public , what explained perfectly to the Commission and in ten years received those , invitations to travel , writings of golf , restaurants , parties of World and bribery of companies the sector of the construction for a total of 736.000 USD , all this to change of contracts of illegal whose costs writings .
other officials of the network road have admitted that received money for point the bills between a 30 % and a 40 % in concept of they structural .
also , a organizing the party the Mayor , Martin Dumont , was to M. writings of have fact the a eye deliberately to a budget parallel and particularly their coffers of money dirty .
to as of these revelations , M. writings resigned to principles of November and was to Montreal to a crisis huge .
writings writings was a of the first policies elected of Montreal that was alarm the bell .
as writings the district of Rivière-des-Prairies , in the this of the island , opposed since 2010 to the sale of a on he taken for 5 million of USD and writings for 1,6 million to the established in full ourselves really .
the 70 % the money of the campaigns election was money writings
of the research that finally will to out , she ensures that responsible &quot; of a which for power understand the to the system , writings for writings , for stop the writings and may to the guilty &quot; .
and they that the process is &quot; painful , but positive &quot; .
we their the seriously but would lack a unity of research treasure in Montreal and be very vigilant for that the practices greens not kind .
how to the been .
regularly .
Jacques writings , for their part , states that &quot; the officials have using hundreds of million of USD &quot; , but is writings on all for the role of the &apos; &quot; political elected the aware of the cynics &quot; .
writings in a 70 % the proportion of money dirty that on to the funding of campaigns election in Quebec , writings and &quot; i have said that that not is more that a for a of the reality &quot; .
the government writings proposes limit to 100 USD the donations to parties , but that not will the organ , according he , &quot; while not speaking strictly the expenditure election , will money dirty in the policy &quot; .
writings a review full the system of fair of contracts public and of funding of the parties and &quot; not we fall more under ; go the fund of the things , with courage , we will rebuild the house with a more solid , with more controls and laws &quot; .
if this history colours the image international of Quebec and of Montreal , M. writings invites to those that traffickers to from the mirror .
&quot; it the writings not is the us Barcelona exports! &quot;
this season has taken a new entity with the writings .

to from of now , can it any it .
but we much that say with to many and very good teams European .
we , for start , an the first of our League with the writings for power receive the back of writings of end .
the writings can become in a great club European to short the ?
already has the budget ...
for become in a great club European , Paris has that earn titles and be that to long the .
today for today , that not is the case .
to level economic , the writings is taken to their means for that that project combined .
not earn the World in the League 1 , as in the last season , would a great failure ?
for of , would a great disappointment .
this year we to invest all our efforts in take that title of national .
in the last season not we far .
in May we we a disappointment , already that had with the conditions optimum for i first .
we a season strong .
nuclear with 79 points .
usually , with 79 points should have been national ...
but another team , the writings , had a season quite better .
this year i that will the good .
even if the large teams as the been , the Lyon and the writings are for the title , i that we with the weapons for writings .
believes that the means expect more the writings ?
is normal that valued much of us if we in what that has made in the players that we .
what we accepted totally .
after of that writings 4-0 in house to writings , that still are with things that criticise is a little frustrating .
we ask what more expected the people .
never we earn 4-0 all the for of week .
it not we the us Barcelona writings
we of to in set a project of at .
a team our with time .
in the League of national we shown that we respond and be present .
it look the Manchester say that , after two writings , not has achieved van for writings of end , and they also have made it writings
in a of the sums Atomic , the writings with 15 points of advantage to the working .
that would neglect to our adversaries and the Cup of France .
Lyon and been , that not were well the season previous , have seen &quot; powered &quot; for this new writings .
that shows that the League 1 is now .
hope that in May we say with a is that , to despite of all the difficulties , we yet us the prize .
the writings seems totally dependent of the successes of you writings .
better that for that we a &quot; writings &quot; .
that to say that writings is very competent and that fail many line .
has been for demonstrate that is the star of the League 1 .
and has shown in all the teams for the that has last that is a great player , a star World .
in the group respect the man and the player .
and he also respects to the men that has to their around .
what that has fact is truly exceptional .
that prompts to the other to increase their level of at .
writings Silva , one of the best defenders the world , to also that all of .
how you experienced the Euro 2012 with the team of France ?
has been a disappointment .
was very about for participate in this Euro .
and , my taken i was Luxembourg time of at .
I things that and came a .
today achievement play good parties in the selection .
is what that expected since my baptism with the &quot; writings &quot; .
came the lesson of what that happened in Ukraine and to this must that today we a behaviour exemplary .
what vision you the first month of Didier writings the with of the &quot; writings &quot; ?
is Stabilisation results .
are well in in the group of classification for the World .
the writings is rigorous , near to the players and continues to earn .
as was the case of Laurent Mont .
but not i to comparisons .
Mont but their aim of writings for the Euro .
hope that Didier writings and to the selection to Brazil .
the score ( 1-1 ) the 16 of October in Spain served for lay the a ?
that at we was confidence .
every one writings for all .
before of that shock in Spain , not had experienced a at it in all my career .
with writings , pay and sell without writings
all what contrary to the trade monetary current , digital in the banks power , the transactions identified and the to of processing between the parties .
also , as to often happens in the technologies , the vision policy is if and the belief of that the system Monetary current , up of monopolies banking , has to the crisis financial .
of fact , writings , specialist for writings writings ( a writings ) , is to the time a currency virtual writings to USD , EUR , etc. and a Protocol of change sure to the way of writings , that to the exchange of here of as to as .
have were close of 200.000 transactions thank to 15.000 computers of the network .
and close of a billion websites website others the writings as donations or as way of payment .
the prices the writings , after have come to the top of 30 USD ( 23 EUR ) in June of 2011 , fell to 2 USD five months more afternoon , before of to today to haunt the ten USD ( the contributions writings in the page bitcoincharts.com ) .
not is nothing impressive if what compared with the changes global in currency real or in products financial .
without embargo , the Bank Central European ( ECB ) was for he in a report on the currencies gambling published in October .
in he , described the writings as &quot; the currency virtual with more success &quot; , &quot; that Nabucco with the dollar or the euro &quot; and &quot; similar to the currencies conventional &quot; .
writings difference of other systems with types of currencies gambling as the &quot; appropriations &quot; , used for move in a writings and that can earn playing or can buy ( and even in times writings ) .
the network social Facebook was also this kind of system .
but in all exchange a authority Central control and is the changes .
with the writings , all the safer of network are to the time privileges of books of accounting , writings , on of currency and buyers and sellers .
how works that network ?
every compromise between two users ago in reality between two different electronic in way of email an .
a such can choose a direction different for every payment , thus the anonymity .
a whole of information linked to this compromise signing securities to through of a system of code to dual key .
the network can foods the authenticity of the compromise .
thank the content the Mens , is also possible ensure that the changes of writings appear in the book of accounts public , that propagated for all the network .
the milestone key is in drawing that new compromise in that book .
this is for the resolution of a challenge have launched to the computers and the election , a kind of exceptionally Central interim , will the privileged of add that line supplementary .
is of a phase of writings of Mens , is say , of transformation of a great Mens in a left strength more shorter and only .
the computers &quot; you &quot; the new compromise and add a number before of &quot; writings &quot; the whole .
the aim is find the number that will a left particular ( more zeros the principle ) .
a time that is that number , the other safer writings easily that is the good .
the compromise is then writings type to the chain of joint of the other transactions ; all change change the left .
if , for commit a fraud , a such like pay two sometimes with the same money very faster ( in less of ten minutes ) , the network only accept as shall a of the two transactions ; the other such Europe' , already that both have fingerprinting different .
the computer that it the challenge has 50 writings .
for avoid the inflation , that inspection into in two regularly , with likely before the end of 2012 .
the number of writings in movement is , because , limited to 21 million , but are writings to the writings , what that leaves a for broad .
the difficulty of this challenge strikes also in every increase of the power of calculation .
the life of the network has already their ups .
the websites website that offer services for writings have been attacked and have using writings in was .
&quot; the ruling used not affects the same Protocol &quot; , ensures pierre writings , that just of launch writings , a company of payment in currency real that used the network writings .
the ECB has in account also the for of writings of money thank to this service blame .
but the money in effective there the same responsible .
the players of weight as writings reject the payments of this kind .
other , as the platform writings , the others .
recently , – writings and writings liqueurs , the writings writings in Israel , study the book of accounting and showed that close the 80 % of writings not records .
in November launched the &quot; tested hired &quot; .
&quot; things 30.000 USD &quot; , writings writings writings , that from for writings , that becomes the writings in gold .
pierre writings , author of a book educational on that currency , believes quite in the potential of this technology also of in the network of transactions .
their system , writings , is to a card of credit ( in currency real ) or to a payment for mobile without contact , but used writings for validate the transactions , that are more EUR .
the I , also , variety their identity and can , for and , stay in the anonymity .
the system is easy of to in set in the victim , that not have that installing new terminals or writings .
they enough with supply a direction that a on can &quot; filming and recognise &quot; , precise pierre writings , that ensures have thousands of users .
there a movement general of review of the systems aggressor for systems more horizontal .
&quot; will lack a time for that writings will , but in 2013 could have a change &quot; , predicts .
for other part , in their report the ECB but enhance the risks various , today as higher , in case of that this currency have success .

a Constitution with writings in writings
is a new dual or nothing the President makes writings .
while that Egypt is more divided that never in as to the statement constitutional , that gives deadlock powers leave , he decided play the all for the all .
writings to all the world for from the Wednesday , when announced that the House which would their text end the day next .
ago so only a week , the head of state had given two months more to this House for an their work .
and ago almost two years that Egypt used a text interim , several sometimes amended , what that weakens the stability institutional and has to writings judicial .
this new initiative not has fact more that increase the Ukrainian in the country .
for their opponents , the President values in their &quot; away approach &quot; and continues &quot; writings their word &quot; and &quot; trampling the right &quot; .
for part of their supporters , ensures that is of a as for an more faster with the crisis institutional and policy and speed the process of transition .
in the next 15 days should organized a referendum .
a space of time very short that forced to the Brotherhood to up to their project of explain the text , Article for Article , to the Egyptians .
for the President , is also of a way of to a legitimation popular and democratic while the controversy cause havoc in all the country .
makes writings seems convinced of that the Egyptians will to their favour , as stated in a interview the periodical American Fund .
considering that that resource has voted with great quickly , contains a now for the people Egyptian and &quot; or vote my text or i the powers leave &quot; , powers that is will to their end with the adoption of the Constitution .
is in that environment strange in the that 85 States of this House which , Islamist in their great majority , voted the text yesterday .
the majority of the Liberals not total to the call .
to the of November , a little before of the statement constitutional , had closed the door because considered that not could to assert their points of a .
the representatives of the rights human , the minorities religious and of the society civil did what same .
to end of that reached the quorum necessary , yesterday for the tomorrow manner to 11 people , States substitutes , to all criticises .
some of they are very close to the Brotherhood Muslim .
as never wait , the articles voted what have been for unanimously .
to the commentators they ago royal , for other part , the fact of that a of the few discrepancies of the working has expressed practically to the time of the sentence , and is that several States the committee arrived to think that the clock of the which was .
the text , that yesterday afternoon was still being voted , over of 234 articles .
the Article 2 , the of all the turned , still being finally with the of the Constitution of 1971 , that stipulated that &quot; the principles of the sharia are the source main the right &quot; .
the parties writings , for who the establishment of the law Islamic is a as fundamental , were that so replace &quot; the principles &quot; for &quot; the rules &quot; , what that would allowed a application more strict .
for the on , that this Article not has been amended is a guarantee of their good will and of their respect towards the other south of the society Egyptian .
the Liberals what writings of hypocrisy and they that not is more that of a immense an .
according they , the Islam of the Constitution ago to through of other articles .
are , in special , the Article 220 , that status to the University Al-Azhar a role consultative , in particular for all who that has of confirmed their accordance with the laws of the sharia .
according the prominent in Egypt Rostopchine writings , is disturbing because &quot; the people call to on not is elected and not has no legitimacy democratic .
here positive the shame of a using &quot; .
the fears of the Liberals are also further for the fact of that the next rector of this University would quite less moderate that the current .
&quot; for now , not there a involvement religious concrete .
with this Constitution we in the framework the state civil .
the majority of the politicians that have working in that text not are writings but university , some of they trained in the system French &quot; , is writings writings , that in a view on the transition constitutional Egyptian .
but is that can have certain ambiguity in about the Article 220 , because the terms employees tired the vocabulary taking .
&quot; we about in particular the term writings &#91; law Islamic , writings &#93; .
and the question that could considered in the future would in what as are the judges civilians competent for on for above of all this &quot; .
more beyond of their are taking , the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that are to the powers most that status the President of the Republic .
the Brotherhood Muslim argue that are few in compared with the that were for the previous regime .
another point contention and the powers on the army .
with the wish of the military , the review the budget of defence not will put the Parliament , but to a Council national of defence .
not will the Mr of civilians in courts military , as were the associations for the defence of the rights human .
these also showed their concerns relating the text , that they writings .
the crime of blasphemy with and , of now in from , the at are banned , what that could places serious consequences for the freedom of expression , on all the of the press .
also , no Article measure the protection of the women , highlights writings writings , of Rights Rights Rights .
according she , what only positive has been the ban of the torture of agreement with the Article 36 .

&quot; the largest and powerful &quot; you will to Moscow and immigrants reasonable for the writings
while Members and defenders of the rights human is on the consequences that thing the law on the examination for , already have appeared in the country merchants that trade with certified &quot; they &quot;
every year , 13 million of workers immigrants come to Moscow , St Petersburg and other cities of Russia .
in their majority are citizens of countries of Asia Central and , Tajikistan and Turkmenistan .
their only aim is earn money for help to their families that have been in house .
since the 1 of December get in force a law , according the which every immigrant labour be to a examination for to their knowledge of the language Russian .
for now , this rule is applicable only for those that have the intention of work in the sector of provision of services , institutions of services Community , services domestic and trade the for a .
without embargo , with the time , as turns in the service Federal of immigration , the medical will of for all the immigrants .
also , not will enough with be the examination of the language , if not also the of history Russian and the of basis of the legislation .
the knowledge of the language be confirmed even for receive and renew the permission of work .
are derogation the citizens of the countries where the Russian is the language official .
not be subject to this law the people that failed obtain their certified of education and qualifications before of the dissolution of the Union Soviet in 1991 .
assisted , destiny and defence of the writings
the network of centres interviewed will auspices for the Institute of language Russian writings , the University of the friendship of the peoples , the University State of Moscow , the University State of St Petersburg and other institutions of education higher Russian .
the immigrants be stand to the evidence in all the cities , now same in Russia are open more of 160 centres of this kind .
the initiative on the introduction the examination was supported for the Members of the Duma State and for the service Federal of immigration .
but the defenders of the rights , much before of that the law regulation in force , failed many sometimes to this question to the press and and what will this in reality ?
what changes will the mandatory the knowledge of the language , and for the Russian as for the own immigrants ?
in first place , provide the representatives the service of immigration , this will reduce the number of people that suffer &quot; than labour &quot; .
great people about today on the defence of the rights of the immigrants labour , is Emmanuel writings , head of the representation the service Federal of immigration of Russia in Tajikistan .
the defence of their rights must before of their starting .
only a system of selection organised will solve the problem of the workers immigrants in a 90 % of the cases .
the problems the have the immigrants without profession , education , the that not know the language or spend the control doctor .
without the understanding of the language , that writings , the future immigrant will he to find people without unscrupulous that , with the pretext of help , writings a &quot; writings paid &quot; to a naturally and close writings , where he and dozens of other as he consume for months without food or documents , working of 12 to 14 hours the day .
we a but of complaints of our immigrants .
&quot; in their homeland they turns a it , but the to are european , they deprived of their passports , not they paid the wages promised &quot; , that the head of the direction of immigration labour the service of immigration of Tajikistan , writings Sharipov .
it not agreeing , writings writings
without embargo , while and many citizens of the republics of Asia Central that want work in Russia will that not only not know the language the country the that to go , but that also in their language own written with difficulty .
for of , this not is and their blame but their own to and are few the Turkmen , writings , writings that can be the luxury of receive education primary normal .
this must to that their families even not have nothing that give of are to the children , for not about already of writings , writings and writings what necessary for the school .
the to to the adolescence , these boys lawfully to work to the first opportunity .
is difficult , if not know the language , will they .
&quot; one feel humiliated and from &quot; .
without embargo , in what that concerns to the law on the language , the defenders of the rights extent a point important .
the medical will to out only for those immigrants whose status be legal .
if not have that status , not will or examination and , in result , no work official .
while and , the majority of the workers immigrants still living in Russia illegally .
&quot; welcome or banned the step to strangers &quot;
many visitors state that receive the status official in our country not is so easy .
the cause is in the obstacles bureaucratic and in the difficulties of the language in .
also , the legalisation costs money and of twelve billion to sixteen billion writings .
without embargo , a actually seem can to quickly and for only billion a writings .
the employees of the police Russian know that generally we documents they , not we registered and with the cases of extortion .
&quot; we they hundred or DTP writings for cigarettes or teaspoons &quot; , told to the journalists the citizen of Tajikistan , writings writings .
&quot; we , not : writings , purchase a paint &quot;

for of , arrived to the hands of the new owners not as gift and every immigrant , writings make the task of it the evidence , paid for the document seven billion writings .
this is two sometimes and a more expensive that the procedure official of examination , that cost the worker immigrant three billion writings .
the main task for a future next is protect the system against the corruption for that the &quot; qualifications &quot; not can buy , admission the officials the government and the defenders of the rights .
to the at , the authorities can he to the workers immigrants that not would been it with success the examination the first time more time for to the course basic of the language .
also , to the immigrants that not speak Russian they will work that not require communication active with the people .

are in strike the employees of restaurants of food swift and supermarket in EE.UU.
to a quarter part of adolescents Americans are their first work as cash in &quot; city &apos; lines: &quot;
in the last days , in the Member United has on a wave of protests against the Netherlands wages that paid in the supermarket of the achieve writings and in restaurants of the popular chains of food swift , such as &quot; city &apos; lines: &quot; , &quot; writings Luther &quot; , &quot; writings writings &quot; , &quot; writings &apos; lines: &quot; and &quot; writings writings writings &quot; .
for now no if to count if will or not this wave to the nine points , or if has for lose forces and writings in their first stages .
the actions of protest have with the support of the unions and of a series of NGOs of left .
also the increase of the modest wages received for the workers of writings and the the system of food swift , the aim of the organisers of the protests is the creation of unions of workers in these companies .
for now , this sector of the economy practically not has been occupied for the movement trade .
forty and six kozloduy the year ?
the actions in the week last , after the day of action of thank , the called &quot; on black &quot; . that day , in Member United writings the orgy of tested that tuna to million of inhabitants , and that to sometimes was by of clashes .
that day , some workers of the achieve writings , that utilised to 2,2 million of people in the world , left their jobs of work and writings writings of protest together to the unions and activists of left in the shops of the achieve , whose products addressed to people of income modest and Pakistani .
writings sells of all , since writings , references of a and batteries for cars , to writings , eggs and milk .
the products in their shops are of average between a 8 % and a 27 % more cheap that the of the supermarket more large .
is for that that many workers rapid of writings buy only in the work .
the availability and the had of products have fact of writings a of the do more large of dictatorial .
according the words two critical , writings can afford the luxury of sell products to very under price , in part because would little to their workers .
these last also complain of the poor conditions labour , such as the lack of writings or brought of hand .
that &quot; on black &quot; the participants of the demonstration demanded the increase of wages and were of that the cost the sure of health provided for the achieve happened of 30 to 100 USD month .
for a worker typical of writings , that have 9,5 USD for time , this spending is excessive , said .
scientists of the University of California in writings argue that if writings is the salary a to 12 $ for time , this cost to the achieve 3,2 that of USD .
this is approximately a 1,1 % more of what that spent in wages now .
if writings cart the increase wage in the of of the consumers , every visit to the shop they will only 46 kozloduy more expensive .
in a year they ones the ludicrous amount of 12,39 USD more of what that on now .
the supporters of writings word satisfied that the protest had place so only in nine Member and that not caused no loss to the achieve .
the &quot; on black &quot; have in their shops since the 8 of the afternoon the Thursday to the midnight the day next and , for that time , writings sold around of 5000 articles for second .
in total , their boxes writings there the &quot; on black &quot; almost 100 million of transactions .
the representative of the company , give writings , declared in a interview the on website of left writings , that left their since of work &quot; less of five &quot; employees of writings and that the protest not had been more that &quot; another are of relations public &quot; , organised for the trade of workers .
&quot; it cash free exports! &quot;
the protests continued this week in new York , in the that the objectives not were precisely the large stores writings ( that in this progressive city not they have love , and for that for now not there none ) , but the &quot; city &apos; lines: &quot; and other restaurants cheap .
it city &apos; lines: says that sells thousands of million of pieces , and then or even you land the and for disease and not you paid for your work honest writings
writings writings , Member the Council he of new writings
currently , of agreement with the law Federal and the of new York , the salary minimum is of 7,25 $ for time .
the restaurants of food swift what will increasing with the time , but only to , and of average , the workers ordinary receive in new York 8,90 USD for time .
no earns less that they in this city .
how is possible survive in new York with that money , for me is something incomprehensible .
there a time when almost the quarter part of the adolescents Americans Slovenia for the city &apos; lines: and they there , behind of the this , to time from after of the school , although still living with their parents .
few were the that saw this as the main source of income or writings stay there much time .
now , constantly writings in some Mr with workers of city &apos; lines: that complain of that have that live of this salary , and to sometimes even only to their children .
for another side , in a forum of the magazine Street Street Journal there a I whose author out that is irresponsible have children if not know with what give of are .
the participants in the protests , that in to the 6 and 30 of the tomorrow the Thursday in the city &apos; lines: of the 40th Street and writings writings , demanded that to the cash and chefs of food swift they it to pay for what less 15 $ for time , or be , that they European their salary minimum current .
also demanded that in the sector of the food swift believe unions of workers .
the law of the EE.UU. banning to the administration meaningful this right and punish to the activists the movement trade with think and people .
for other part , have time the administration they makes the life .
but , for reasons objective , is easy that the unions writings the sector of food writings .
a of the main is the excessive rotating the staff .
writings
writings protests had place that same day in other restaurants cheap of Manhattan .
the culmination of the action had place to half the rally in the city &apos; lines: it close of Times clearest , in the that took several political Democrats local , in particular the Member the Council he of the city writings writings , that said and &quot; city &apos; lines: says that is markets thousands of million of pieces , and then or even you it a hospital or you would for your work honest &quot; .
the demonstrators received the support of other than Democrats of new York , for example the candidate to Mayor of the city Philips of writings , that said that &quot; we support to the workers the sector of food swift for that forgetting receive wages fair and the prosperity economic that deserves every writings &quot; .
as what described the newspaper no York Times , this has been the greater demonstration of this kind in the history American of the food swift .
but in she took only a few hundreds of people , even not all they were employees the service of food swift , in the that writings tens of thousands of people of new York .
still not is clear if this will of area for to a movement mass .
&quot; for now , is the brain not is so easy &quot;
the issue of the reality network , so popular between the fans to the technologies modern , recently is with normal mainly to through the prism of from special .
to beginning the summer , in their Conference annual Google showed a model in movement and subsequently , in November , it that Microsoft had presented also a request for demand the on patent .
without embargo , of a conversation with the head the group of technology interactive 3D in the laboratory of Microsoft of lecture , writings writings , writings that for the scientists of this company , the from already other to a stage last .
to they they situation the we of the manipulation of and gambling in the air with the hands bare and the creation of constitution gambling open .
- for favour , in terms general , what is the the of study of their group of research ?
- we are to the interaction persona-ordenador , but also we of extend the limits of this interaction .
for now the humanity in their great mass has been trapped in the stage of work with the writings of the screen finding , to sometimes the it with the should .
but us we look 5-10 years from and ever the changes writings in this interaction .
for example , the registered writings and the sensors writings represent a step from and today in day no writings sells without writings , already that to all they interested the control for listening .
- what more we place the future ?
- to despite of that writings has taken the interaction the level psychological , great part of this still happens in a screen finding , to sometimes in 3D .
the introduction of information has consumers ( the system have more data ) , and the exit still not is very good .
we trying of change this , we in systems of writings truly writings , digital writings writings in different technologies , including the of involved .
must release the world of the computer the our , the psychological , do more tangible .
for this , without embargo , is necessary recognise not only the such , but also the space that what surrounding .
then we complete the world real with and gambling of a way more relating .
in first place , it the considers with these Czechs! time of reality virtual writings
- what of you on the control for voice ?
a detail very popular , but not believes that what writings ?
- clear that not can be a universal , is remains of solve the question of privacy , already that not always to that the other through of our actions and intentions .
of fact , all the types of interaction with writings are good , but every one in their own camp .
for example , for the control of will in places public , we a project in the that we in the listening , but not in movements wild , but more short .
also , the listening were caught not for the House the device , but for a process that Office the movement of the bones and the truly .
for now is very largest , but in theory can be reduced the size of a clock of process .
but , in general , the future is for a kind combined of control , for example of gesture Equality voice .
- how is that ?
- for example , how i would you that Parliament's this Britain: of writings ?
you about and the will the same time .
- usually I only i .
- That , that is to be very difficult of recognise .
- or be , you to force to the users to adapt to what that can or not can to in this at the machine ?
- not necessarily , but is a is mutual .
i that in a future next we to have that work mainly in the involved of new types of sensors that can determining with precisely the reactions of the person .
these can be , for example , sensors writings , already that provide a good resolution in depth , what that is very important .
- if we of their work with the sensors of writings writings , what complaints has you of the a modern ?
they lack resolution , depth or something more ?
- in principle , the generation current is what that can be the start of our work with the recognition writings .
for of , would good obtain 8 writings to the at of 1000 writings .
but the question not is in the writings , but in the quality of the advocates and in the depth .
since this last point of a , all the technologies current not are what enough good for us ; this it more work to the designers of writings .
or be , that we that remember not only the resolution in the central Parliament and and , but also in Z.
also is important the at , the number of which for second .
the movements human are quite dynamic and the current of 30 writings are truly even , on all for the listening .
writings writings , of our laboratory in writings , was a rises of contact with disorder writings of processing of 1 to 100 writings and is mention that the modern sensors produced in series are more close the second value ( 60-100 ) .
not all the world understand in what as this affects to the interaction hombre-máquina .
to me i would very useful for my work a equivalent of such device , but that not take contact for that the which for second be more .
- and not is necessary increase the number of a ?
- the writings has now three &quot; a &quot; , a of the which is of fact the supported of how ultraviolet and the second the points of the signal be .
but the third House is in reality a just rises the writings visible .
this not used for determining the depth the the .
potentially , more amount of a could solve the problem ...
or the contrary , had and struggle the amount required of somewhere .
would good create a prove it of writings , play with the shapes of location of the a and see how this help to writings the position writings .
- for what that I i , Microsoft , to difference of Google , not has presented their from the public .
not seems that , since the point of a the use every of technologies of reality network , the from are a of the platforms more of ?
- for of , it all the harp consulting in high a on intelligent in the hands , not is very comfortable , but I i and the better option would a reality network &quot; writings &quot; when , in basis of a platform of cloud , you could it of the from the on intelligent ,
the from are will very personal , in that is their force ( the things private only you will see ) , but also their weakness and a reality network on in from not will work on and gambling together with other people .
- imagine for a at that the manipulation of and writings gambling in the air is available not only for Tony writings of the film &quot; open writings &quot; , but also for any just annihilation .
there a problem in this idea that the critical often point and it not there response writings writings
it the hands not feel nothing writings
what answers in their group for this challenge ?
- in my conferences to often say that the reality network is the seventh just in the interaction between the man and the machine .
i that the eighth well could be the addition of awoke writings .
while and , one of the tricks more interesting is the use of the second hand in quality of report for the image .
it have the you perfectly writings
but there also technologies that are truly whole to give writings to these &quot; images in the air &quot; . for example , the interference of several how writings targeted to a point specific where is the should it a feeling similar to the that one feel if someone as writings in the writings of the it , but that feeling still is very weak .
there also writings for the wooden that have in the writings writings of the it , this also a direction last .
- has Treaty of is the brain ?
to think that he feel what that seems that should feel in the at in that is something ?
- that is a good idea , still not what we tried .
here this another challenge with the that we that fight for much time , how to that a person with set in a space very reduced creates that is to a space open , almost without end . we working also in the idea of the tapes of those ( not as the of the writings ) , platforms it , as the of the skies hired .
for now , is the brain not is so easy , still there that work for many years .
that is what that ago attractive the work with the reality virtual for the researchers , that many things are in a state of total mindset .
pleased staff writings in place of culture - Rosbalt.ru
&quot; writings &quot; continues the project &quot; writings of St Petersburg &quot; , dedicated to the citizens that are ahead , to the we the art and of the culture .

when was young was such which that a writings the writings the in the wall the side of steel and writings .
I started with Union , with the that for what general the people expires .
now to often particular the effective .
say culture impoverishment , culture of consumption .
not there no culture in the consumption , that is other history .
I am a man of the culture of yesterday , up under the example of artists that living in the poverty and writings in the poverty , obstruct the money only for paint which .
I am to favour of this culture .
- writings , what is what that lack to St Petersburg ?
- good experts in culture .
there a concept and official of the culture .
but not all they can dedicated to the culture .
when the pagan were the fish all was of other way , the pagan such time not evidence very well the culture , but knew that was necessary to to the experts fish .
in Moscow now there very good recommended .
we people in St Petersburg that well could be experts , but are closed , because need experts to a level higher that consider correctly to for and they open way .
now is writings the pleased staff writings .
what same writings , but the difference is that they say quite that not all the art modern is accepted , there some artists that have that find other cultural .
- what is for IT St Petersburg ?
- St Petersburg not is a capital cultural . in Moscow there great more culture , there there on .
but on our stones is difficult that the art inclination .
need on cultural and we now more existing that readers , this is .
in Europe there a lot of people with curious that is to planned and testing .
in our case , this kind is tiny .
we that to that the art is of fashion , as what was to at the century last .
the project premier with a subsidy of St Petersburg .
give to light in the writings
the earth is in danger .
warming global or or with a Eros sight .
upgraded of dozen various with human to then proceed in for of a planet of parts .
for be the humanity ago the question main and how continue the kind in conditions of resignation or in the same planet of parts ?
i that there little where choose .
of fact , only two are real writings that can be writings , the less writings .
&quot; these are Venus's and staff &quot; , says the way head the Institute astronomic State , writings P.K. ( writings ) , behest writings .
but if the conditions in staff are best for the life , in the area of Venus's the temperature is of 500 degrees .
only can live to large aeroplanes or in the orbit of Venus's ... in the space .
started to we the problems of reproduction in the space with the flora .
ago already a century that were to out experiments with plants .
four generations of peas played in orbit not upon in nothing of the varieties Landmines .
after wine the rearing of there in the orbit , small crack of the fruit , the writings .
in 1979 were the space eggs of spring for to how be the an in conditions of resignation .
helps as result a writings normal .
but then start the problems .
&quot; the problem is in that this writings has that find support , must is on their own feet and start to moving &quot; , is behest writings , the director the laboratory the Institute of problems writings ( writings ) of the Academy of Sciences of Russia .
the not find support , the writings they writings the gambling .
and after of 10 hours in the on born was a writings total of the a .
the writings not ECU to the light or the were .
and the to was that the out of four days simply writings .
&quot; and two sometimes we that writings the writings , but then what we because was impossible work there with they &quot; , , is behest writings on failure the experiment with the writings in the space .
the last time that a &quot; writings &quot; is flew to the orbit was ago 16 years .
in the spring the 2013 will the experiments .
without embargo , in the writings &quot; writings &quot; only travel species of a same sex .
there a experiment with muskrats , that were for the space already with tissue .
in principle , not found nothing writings .
&quot; this was precisely in the writings , but this was a experiment only , and studies as this must be to out &quot; , is behest writings .
after the landing , the muskrats various had cloned .
without embargo , still not has have we the problem of the reproduction directly in the space .
is a challenge difficult .
the animals , the lose their they customary , simply not can to their he sexual .
the man , without embargo , to difference of the small animals , in principle , can .
the writings writings has the reasoning abstract and is able of create a fund emotional appropriate .
experiments similar not for to out for reasons ethical .
but the women travel the space since ago already 50 years .
the greater risk what happened writings .
and what more thing that has the humanity is the Atomic sometimes .
our writings flying , and no in the earth could say and if is after of a flight the space .
will or not have a baby after of this flight .
&quot; after of all , to this question no has responded &quot; , is the old the sector aerospace writings writings .
in June of 1964 , only after of a year the flight the space , the first woman writings , writings writings , was to light to a daughter .
the father of the her , writings writings , was also writings .
in 1988 , the second woman writings , Svetlana writings , who two sometimes was in orbit and even worked in the space open , had a son .
without embargo , the risk are .
we few , are Mr Yuschenko the gone to who after of long flights all they has result well , and a generation harmonious is growing .
&quot; and if can say more , is dangerous even in flights writings &quot; , welcomed the pilot writings , hero of the Union Soviet , hero of Russia , writings writings .
without embargo , the humanity must find some new in the biotechnology , in the protection radiation , in the creation of the patient's artificial .
the writings the centre of preparation of writings is a stage compulsory in the preparation for the flight .
in conditions of writings court's , the writings taking their skills of work in the space .
the water writings the resignation .
if for a adult the water is a environment comfortable , although still hostile , for a child on born is their element very .
the small hombres-anfibio seem confirmed that the life in the earth and the on .
there a connection between the fact of that the baby who approximately 9 months within of their mother in the proceeds writings , because will more easy used then the water .
in principle , this is it , because since the at the birth to the at the first bathing spend only 2 weeks .
&quot; this is very little for forget something &quot; , says naval writings , writings of aspiring of on born .
in synopsis , if the resignation is a state more natural for a on born , for the women is necessary the writings , the force of the patient's .
in the resignation the truly internal and of the writings writings very faster , the capacity of from the gets reduces .
good , writings that , have in the action of encouraging for the childbirth .
can , for of , give to light in a House special , this what writings .
&quot; and then what ? &quot; , writings writings ago this original question .
for other part , the child also needs patient's artificial .
without the feeling of patient's , the Atomic not generated the spine or the system writings .
to a on born in orbit is impossible writings with a and special for writings , as to the adults .
simply thus of what that is vital for he .
&quot; and this experiment that we to to together , the allow the birth of a child in a environment strange , will place to that bring to the earth to a person , to a person totally suit &quot; , but the head the committee of both the Institute of problems writings of the Academy of Sciences of Russia , arrested writings .
for now , the birth of children in the space is a question theoretical .
without embargo , with the time this will a reality , when the human human in their dozen countries’ to a planet regulate that will the home for their children born in the space .
head of writings and the inspection the system &quot; writings &quot; not has given with the political writings
in on of AVENTINUS public , the Republic Czech account with good inspectors and a legislation of quality , although their application writings .
what that waiver writings , chairman of the office of control by ( writings ) in a interview for Aktuálně.cz.
&quot; the law never will perfect &quot; , but their application must be right . &quot; this is , in my opinion , what that we lack &quot; , describes the situation current .
the controls joint of the inspectors Czechs and Germans also come to conclusions similar .
as example of a practice incorrect , mentioned the attitude of writings writings towards the system of be independent only on the role , that knows as the system &quot; writings &quot; .
the first Minister said recently that the writings ( party democratic along ) not writings to the employers with inspectors . then , is banned or allowed ?
&quot; the law must be what of some way and if banning something , in that case , or the President the government can prevent the action of the office that has the duty of to these controls or demand obligations &quot; , relate writings .
in the meeting of the Commission of control in the Congress of the Members , Ud. spoke the project common between the team Czech and the German , in the framework the which cemetery the legislation which to the AVENTINUS public in both countries .
what is exactly ?
is of a control parallel that we to to ago a two years .
said of way have and the legislation European writings how must organise the AVENTINUS public , to this still the legislation force in every country and , after , the practice in .
us what we Kingdom all and , although the control still not has still , we obtained differences very interesting . generally , the legislation of our country is &quot; more strict and more full &quot; , without embargo , the practice concrete in some parameters is better in Germany .
that , because , that not enough with in rules every time more stricter , but that is necessary on in the application of the law same .
what can give of fact this project ? what believes that are the conclusions ?
precisely a control common of this kind could help to that we of invest efforts in the to of the laws , the reduction and the improvement of the limits , although this not have a impact so positive .
the economy the savings means to a it proper to a price it ( what that not always means that the price be the more under ) for avoid the enrichment and , to the long , the actions criminal .
but not for the fact of reduce the limit of the AVENTINUS to say that we to this .
perhaps because the system is far with and &quot; tendering &quot; , that those that want find for in the system be do more easily that if the limits circumstances so higher as now .
Ud. about of the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the writings of the AVENTINUS public .
how works the system of controls in Germany ?
is a office analogous to our writings or I of other way ?
in how to the offices , as the writings , there it the writings ( Court Federal of accounts ) , with a organisation similar to the our , with a school also , what only is that in their case is tune of a way a and different , but in principle both offices time at .
also the powers are to true point writings , without embargo , in and that Germany has a organisation Federal , the courts of accounts are even to this level . in this aspect from to of our system .
the Court Federal of accounts ( writings ) only can control the money Federal , what that here we funds state .
the funds public , that are administered for the regions and the municipalities , there , in Germany , control in the Court Federal of accounts .
in as to the legislation local , is more simple that the our ?
for what general , not i like establish a compared without data specific . not but , Germany still being a model in some aspects , but not can legislative with have in what is better .
could be better , for example , in as to the quality of the inspectors ?
that sure that not , but , i , not i like to this kind of comparisons .
is necessary say that even those countries that we as model must to with to a great number of problems .
if not outside , not they would no benefit work with our office , not believes ?
in as to the legislation of our country , what meant for their office the amendment of law on the AVENTINUS public ? exists of some way their these ?
with in account that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short , still not has about in the were of control .
given that we controls former , is we have with a true delay .
for now , were in the process of preparation of the controls future and we on a new tool of &quot; detection of risks not economic &quot; , for the that we fact it almost 14.000 AVENTINUS public , that have been considered . the changes will perfectly reflected here , already that are the limits , needs the conditions of some types the process of selection and similar .
as that the discharge of this law is such or that , more well , is a large for the system bureaucratic ?
i that this law is this a step in the direction right and hope that be .
the problem that can made is that the regulation &quot; harmonised &quot; and that be impossible you .
already with the regulation previous , the people controlled were linked the contractor ( for example , in the case of the programmes operational regional the Council regional ) , and every law not respected in on of AVENTINUS public this the violation of the discipline budget .
has sense then tighten the law of this way ?
i that not of this way .
the system must exclude to those that want writings or so of he and not punish to those that commit a ruling formal , that not has these in the taking of decisions .
a system of this kind only will create a greater pressure responsible .
and how is of this ?
we towards where we has this way on .
the first Minister has declared recently that the writings not writings to the employers with controls the called system writings , with reference the fact of be independent only on the role . what means this ?
the system writings &quot; is banned or allowed ?
the law must be what of some way and , if banning something , then or even the first Minister the government can prevent the action of the office that has the duty of to these controls and demand obligations .
can say and &quot; writings the law and what we &quot; , but not can say that we as if nothing .
in the law on the AVENTINUS public , the regulation is quite strict in as the way in that must act formally . and is as must be for protect the competition public .
but , for another side , is tragic that be the candidate with the better supply for not to the demands formal .
the law never will perfect , but their application must be right . this is , in my opinion , what that we lack .

the at not do of means economic sufficient for pay to the teachers and we a writings for do possible .
in the framework of the completion of the works in writings writings , there a building independent the that we writings with this project .
in every appropriate which several groups and I .
what are the criteria of selection ?
we up a programme that be attractive for all the generations , including the children .
for example , in Prague writings writings , writings writings , writings with give writings , the writings writings , writings writings and absolutely writings .
for obtain information more detailed , look!" consultation www.kpks.cz.

the year that is also we like on in the writings couple really of new York and to me , personally , advantage that we in Member United , i like amplify with were in Washington and in writings .
writings plans in the abroad not are precisely writings , to now you acted for example in Madrid , Brussels , London or Moscow .
the writings writings is , not but , a group formed for people with disabilities .
how is the logistics and the organisation of these travel ?
not is so difficult how can a to first a .
there five States in his of wheelchair power , the chairs must travel in the which for stricter and also we much weight , the boxes with the instruments ...
without embargo , to now we the we managed well . writings and British Airways were perfectly prepared , it that not leaves of puzzles .
even in Moscow , of where we on ago little , went all without problems .
thank to the outlet the abroad look!" compare the different attitudes of the society towards the disabled and other aspects .
with what the you found to now ?
in Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other cities , all works better that here ; in Russia we been witnessing of that , in the this , is much way for go .
to difference of Prague , Moscow is full of barriers , there still without be among that a person wherever one for the centre of the city in a his of wheelchair power .
something so aware as is , for example , give preference to someone in his of wheelchair in lift , there not what is .
for fate , has created a partnership civil that strives for writings the problems of the people with disabilities .
in what aspects we take example of countries more ahead ?
there many aspects in the that we for behind ...
but is important mention that the as and the improvement of the situation always on of the people to the that affects directly .
in London and in Madrid is very normal that the people with a disabilities serious wherever for their account in public and can go the service , the Museum , where want ...
but not is very common that a great number of people with disabilities be in the life social of way active , in this aspect , with the writings writings it we a little for ahead writings
a society develop or without barriers is a it , but when will the at in the that so from athletes , artists , players , political or lawyers , will to change all of truth .
to now , are cases isolated of people that have a great force of will .
the group the writings writings is currently very popular , but if at a years back , what the was to be the group in 1998 ?
i as writings in writings writings , where had great people young to my around that wanted dedicated to something .
and since that I am as , if , between other , the writings , writings a group healthier with a area of work .
and with the time , as says our writings writings writings , we was a little of the hands ( laughter ) .
without embargo , the popularity not was to these last years , or i also ?
is truth that we helped quite the fact of connect with singers famous and also work actively for promoting the group .
we to the conclusion of that the work that not is , is as if not there .
thank to the aid of the Union European , we afford also such of quality , equipment , etc.
had intention of to so far with the writings writings ?
since the principle I the potential that had , that can to something of another way .
the world the international is full of things that seem the to the other .
is it , to their way , all what new welcomes with caution and it much time in natural .
there few things intervention , but i dare to say that the writings writings is a of them .
the impression of someone that we is for first time is clearly the compassion , is a reaction natural ...
but the compassion is totally superfluous because the people with disabilities not are human dumped that suffer and of the that should have compassion .
there people that is able of live a life full and develop , with the status , for of , of that so of the means necessary .
I always say that if something they is well to people with disabilities , then , not is only a progress for they , but for all the society .
helped the fact of that is Ud. a head highly , as describes great people ?
if we to a work of quality , we that be rigorous in many aspects and demand certain discipline .
i that is completely normal .
some people come with a vision now and with the head in the clouds and when hear that have that their two days to bring , go to the proof preparatory and it much time moving and in testing , the euphoria initial they established quickly .
but is how works in all parties , in every group that to work and to something .
currently the group the writings writings has twenty States .
many of they were already in the beginning the year 1998 ?
only one and writings writings .
we a group open , the people get and is , not can avoid .
who have will and when will always the doors writings
will the day before the expected end the world , the Thursday 20.12.2012 to the 21 writings
will place in the writings bit of Prague , in writings of about and in writings in writings and will 12 groups and other musicians' of the Republic writings
the three cities connected the end of the memorable to through of Civil for who together the song the group the writings writings &quot; end the world , he &quot;
the aim the appropriate is it the resources necessary for finance equipment system the centre education without barriers writings in writings writings of Prague , whose cost is to 25 million of billion tune .
the entry the appropriate costs 400 writings and the children to 12 years have entry free in the option of sale early in writings
Poland and the writings .
in the meeting of ministers of the countries of the Agency space European held the week last accepted to Poland as to Member of the that . is the second country Member of the that the former block of Europe the this , after of the Republic Czech , that became in Member full the 12 of November of 2008 ) .
Poland was a intensive cooperation with the that in the year 1994 and for the years war was in the Commission of projects of the Agency .
without embargo , the way of Poland towards the writings began much before .
the enthusiasts Polish already and to the flights the space before of the second war World , although not always set their work .
i , for example , the Conference of A. writings in the Monitoring astronomic of Warsaw in the that , the 6 of December of 1933 , presented their ideas on the study pioneering &quot; introduction to the writings &quot; .
the ideas the young engineer ( born the 1905 ) left to the Parliamentary deaf and , years after , writings us that the Dr. report: writings had been the only that had shown interest in their work .
in the year 1934 writings was in France the Prize Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Sainjon writings for their &quot; introduction to the writings &quot; .
the doctor report: writings ( 1899 - 1966 ) , mentioned previously , became more afternoon in a great drive of the space and of the writings .
published hundreds of articles in periodicals Polish and wrote a series of books feel to this discipline scientific .
writings became in a promoter of the writings , was known in all the world and their contribution to the science to writings when was their name to one of the writings of the face hidden of the a .
already in the year 1925 was in Poland a writings that was to be effective of a engine of rockets .
unfortunately , has who was the author of the proposal and not know the writings the project .
not is clear if the rocket was to be used for the start of the writings or for their while .
the information on this writings is to the collection in the press of the time .
to from the year 1933 the it Polish began to dedicated to the missiles .
the research was funded for the writings writings writings in cooperation with the writings . writings writings and writings . writings writings .
to from the material internationally , ago clear that the research was the Strasbourg of the evidence practices .
not but , with the arrival of the troops German , was the research .
in the year 1937 disturbed in the press us the prototype of a missile of a writings designed for the engineer writings and the year next was published the study &quot; writings - writings writings I writings writings &quot; , the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki .
both projects were for the use military of the engines for missiles .
little before of the war , the committee with scientific interim ( writings writings Doradczo-Naukowy ) was of all the projects of techniques of missiles for use military and writings all the work .
the committee was founded in 1937 , but after of two years of activity , to interrupted for the beginning of the war .
other studies feel to the writings appeared in the press Polish after of the war thank the work of the society Polish of writings ( writings writings writings ) .
in the issue of November of 1954 of the magazine writings ago reference for first time to the society with four articles very huge feel to the writings .
in one of they , the writings . M. writings , proposed the creation of a society that devoted to the writings .
in that time already had since in set projects of satellite European and was obvious that the research ancestors’ was a discipline with prospects of future .
since principles of 1956 the society Polish of writings ( writings ) hoped to be part of the Federation international of writings ( based in 1951 ) and in autumn of that same year the writings became in Member full .
the year next the first President of the writings , writings writings ( 1902 - 1959 ) , happened to be the chairman of the Federation international of writings .
occupy this he to their death in 1959 .
to from the 1956 , the writings was of way significant in the development the rocket probe writings ( writings writings ) , that was a success and became in the first rocket Polish in the that was to out research scientific .
the first kind RM-1 was still in 1957 and was for first time the 10 of October of 1958 .
the rocket had a changing of 1.800 metres , a 80 cm of length and not reached to the 5 extract of weight .
more afternoon , end of to the version RM-1A and in summer of 1959 launched the evidence airlines of the rockets RM-2 of two stages in the desert of writings .
the rocket such 1,4 metres and writings a 11,5 kg.
another kind of rocket in development was to be the of study scientific real . the rocket RM-34 was to have a changing of 14,5 km and their mission would control the wind of and .
without embargo , in 1962 Negotiations the work .
the successor of the first rockets the kind writings was the rocket Meteor-1 , that was for the years 1962 and 1965 .
Union as rocket of two stages , with a length total of 510 cm and a weight initial of 32,5 kg.
were three types ( leads Meteor-1A , -1B and -1C ) , that upon between for the space available for the equipment scientists .
in the rocket Meteor-1A the space available for the volume was of 0,4 litres , in the Meteor-1B of 0,34 litres and in the Meteor-1C of 0,62 litres .
the changing maximum in the three types was of 37 km.
between the years 1965 and 1968 was in the Institute air the rocket Meteor-2 , whose first evidence airlines launched in October of 1970 .
the rocket Meteor-2 had a weight initial of 380 extract and was able of a a weight useful of 10 extract to 60 km of and .
subsequently was the version Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 .
is necessary mention also the entry of Poland in the writings ( writings for switzerland note ) in the year 1960 and the training the committee national of writings two years after .
in the framework the programme writings , Poland joined to the research the space writings on satellite European Soviet and , in the year 1978 , the pilot Polish writings writings became in the second writings after of Remek .
the suspension of the law on work social not is the solution .
the week last the trial constitutional judiciary the law writings social .
the resolution much a hot discussion in the society .
since then will interesting look the face existing since a point of a more broad .
the systems economic Liberals in the EU , as that in the world globalised , based in the principle of a greater competition economic and less regulation .
in result , this means that the different forms economic and the systems economic national are in conflict permanent between .
the cause is in the principle the free trade and the movement free and unlimited of capital private , together with the speculation financial unbridled .
the effect of the large differences in the cost labour ( of the wages ) there tensions economic .
under this concept is necessary understand the situation in the that the manufacturer , with the importing of goods EUR , to the each and for this &quot; leads a writings &quot; the price the country's with the aim of done with the greater part the market and , of this way , increase their for of benefits .
to great at means , for the majority of the employers , and the production the abroad , buy there more cheaper or well should . the result is a unemployment high in those countries in the that the price the work , in compared with other economies , is more high .
because to that the capital private not has responsibility social any and , with this , not is for the unemployment that this a generated , overall necessarily the spending social the state .
all this situation leads the total unwillingness of the employers for pay tax and for the damage economic and social that have led in their efforts of obtain benefits .
the situation is universally so known that not is necessary present data statistics specific .
the practices little grounds the capital private for situations , in certain economies , in the that the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of reduce artificially the level social of the own population and , of this way , by capital abroad the country .
said of other way , the governments are capital private to available of their own population without have in account the decline social .
this ago patent on all in the changes of the laws existing .
the aim is force to the population to that accept the dictated the capital private , on all in what that as to the wages .
this has place , for a part , by the system of duty economic in the case of unemployment of long is ; for other , by the right restricted of the employees in as to rights labour .
the result is a poverty increasing together with the increase of the differences between poor and rich .
since ago a series of years , there in Germany points of over of food for people poor that not can is with their own work .
the number of people that receive this kind of aid comes already the million .
in the framework the increase of the competitiveness of the economy German , there a case quite among and people employed with a salary so under that the state must pay the rest for to the minimum order for survive .
was public a scandal of this kind connected with the situation of the employees additional the Parliament Federal German .
the measures of savings of practically all the Member the southern of the EU gets , without place to doubt , to the same situation . the people , breach for a decline writings of their level social , are forced to leave as in the century twentieth or to writings with a salary horrendous in the limit of the society , with the hope of that some day will the country capital recognised private .
is necessary writings of where is ?
in the case of that on of other countries of the EU , then the poverty is of a country to another or not comes never , since that Chinese , Red , brazilian , Turks , Moroccan , Egyptians or African still working for a tiny part of a salary European .
this also affects to all America Latin .
the theories Liberals and the means of communication state to the at that the state not should give capital to the economy , that be the economy leads to their failure .
the capital private it with tooth and and the view of that the state not should intervene in the economy writings in the control .
to then , is necessary we if the capital private not will with their founded in the set policy and , for surrender , in all the state .
in this case the response is clearly maintaining .
the proof is the existence of influence , in the practice very powerful and writings , in all the Member .
the result is a situation desperate that exists in the area of the corruption , in the things social , in a legislation that is practically poor in all parties but not is regarded .
in Germany the situation is the next and the Czech state , to lack of means financial , with the significant of projects of law to companies legal private , the which are to often linked with the industry .
this kind of projects of law are able after in the who , the Parliament German .
of this way , all the power not from the people , such and as keeps in the constitutions of the democracies Western , but of the strong groups financial that represent their own interests .
is obvious that the democracies with a are liberal are quickly in a situation how the that describes writings in their work the crisis of the Republic seen in times of things and writings and &quot; the state was time writings and the governments held to the force &quot; .
to change of bribery , things investigation writings and aid for finance stones or much .
the admissions and the corruption spread without from any and the people Congressional to the turned with the vote writings of advance &quot; ... &quot; not had people with are that writings to a since in the administration , that a time , to cause of this disarray , the state was eight months without consuls &quot; ... &quot; began to summit in serious of that the only be for a situation so serious was the both and that was necessary pick a man major &quot; ... although writings thought in writings , things power the power and into the democracy for always in both .
the conclusion , the same way that in the about , is that the society current on in preferences writings the benefit individual without have in account the interests common .
the capital private not is able , in their essence , of understand and demand the benefits of all the society .
the result is the same that the of then , a deprived of the elite without unprecedented , without that therefore a effort for first in depth .
the causes the rise of the regimes thorough and Communists must for , for what and , in the liberalisation unbridled of the systems economic in the century twentieth and by .
with respect to the situation current , is possible be the disappearance of these systems in benefit of a democracy of kind liberal , as a Christmas lack , to the expected the next coup .
the fact really writings is that the elite current ignores for completely the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives , disasters social and humanitarian of the that we been witnessing , as the crimes against the humanity , such and as the we in the history former and the more recent .
the suspension of the law on AVENTINUS public not is the solution ; the less not to long the .
under pressure of the competition economic , and to level international as within of the EU , the government of the Republic Czech will forced to continue for other for reduce the level social of the population .
this trend is , for what and , both .
the solution is for reforms writings specific , that to and the participation the capital the state as the influence of the citizens in the government and that support the position of monopoly the capital private in the society in benefit the state .
Israel and the laboratory the chaos .
&quot; that writings writings God! writings and writings writings could &quot; ( not arises nothing of the violence and nothing could do ) , writings in their song writings and whose rapporteur A &quot; writings &apos; lines: do not writings writings writings we subjects &quot; ( not we forget of what sea that we ) .
&quot; if my children not want wars , not would no &quot; writings writings , wife of Mayer writings writings , in their sea of death in the year 1849 .
after of the last their of violence between Israel and the in of Gaza , have emerged , as always , reactions various .
a , the side of Israel , going to favour the right of without and writings to the Palestinians in the role of terrorists . the other supports to the Palestinians and alleges racism for part the state of Israel , genocide perpetrated against Arab Palestinians and accordingly to Israel of state terrorist .
not i to in who is guilty of the massacres that occurring where and who is the victim . the end and the out , the citizens of today in day of Israel , including the territories those , born within of the situation policy current and not lived the beginning of the violence .
my intention is offer to the readers a look behind the iron , a look for be who out to of the tensions that which since ago 95 years ( calculated to from of the statement Balfour in November of 1917 ) in a small area of earth the Middle a .
some of my considerations based in facts historical , other in conclusions to the that I come on the basis of my own way of understand the matter , on who or what group of people is the drive main of the events of the history modern .
in the history of the humanity the history of the struggles for the power is in first line .
in every time we find a Alexander Great or a Rostopchine .
but what that already not is so clear is if always were these people the that as their steps of way autonomous or if behind of their better had someone that writings their actions towards a at aim .
we accept that we in a time that which the wealth the world in the hands of a few individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power that this means , not has been to in a one generation .
of between these families writings richest highlights a that could be the more prominent ( if still there someone behind , not what know , but not what may ) and the writings .
not chapter much to close of they .
of .
in the years 90 the century twentieth writings the first Agency of news ( going ) for that should of suggestions their name with acts criminal of great patient's . the power and the wealth , or both , they guaranteed the back , it that for they always meant a in .
have comes important in almost all the banks power the world and in those countries in the that not are represented , has declared or is for a war and before the attack to Afghanistan were 7 countries , after the attack of Iraq were 5 , after of bring to Gaddafi only were four , but project Russia has into the Bank Central the government Russian .
all who that has tried oppose to this family has died .
writings writings refused to renew the state the Bank Central rationale of dictatorial of the writings , began for the war of writings to this money and was murdered in 1865 in the to .
writings started to this money and wanted suspending the system of European Federal ( must ) and was murdered in 1963 ; the Congressman writings writings was poisoned the year 1936 after of to bring to the must for have a the great crisis economic the year 1929 .
their efforts for the power World they was for the years 1859 - 1871 to for a plan with three wars global , designed for the writings add Pike , writings with the degree 33 .
the first war marked as aim eliminate the large Member writings in all Europe ; the second wanted eliminate the supremacy colonial , particularly of great Britain , and the third proposed reduce the population of the earth between a million and billion million of people ( such amount of children for their welfare and luxury would and not writings many resources ) , also of the creation of a religion universal ( the writings not is nothing more that a preliminary for such solution ) and the adoption final of the powers absolute .
the method with the that system the group of the families more richest , together with the writings , still the too the releasing of crisis and the subsequent send of a solution ( the writings writings - order to from the chaos ) .
these solutions are , without embargo , wrong , and these always a in of the situation . if not , enough remember that the must was created for that not i a crisis as the the year 1907 .
that , after the success the murder the as the better austro-húngaro , less Ferdinand , in Sarajevo and after of that , to as of this , development the first war World , tore the Russia developing with the beginning of the revolution Bolshevik .
the first war World Cold of way cabotage and institutionally since the point of a military and economic , the Fraga of Germany ( the wars for an with the Russia developing were already unnecessary ) and the subsequent country of the great power of Europe Central , the rule Austro-Húngaro .
for preparation the on of the second war World , allow that the bankers and political created , of way bloodless , a situation escalating to as of the enormous repairs of war imposed on Germany , with what that were the conditions optimum for the radicalisation of the there — . subsequently , they was with serve to the Germans the solution the writings , that was what enough strong and just and than to guilty , and to after a Czechoslovakia of for several nationalities with a strong minority German that should represent and was so well the role of the fifth spine , that set the is and was the outbreak of the war .
the end the century twentieth , the writings boosted the foundation the movement writings , a branch that hoped to the training of a state Jewish , preferably in the region of the former writings with Jerusalem as capital ( return the writings ) .
the statement Balfour in previously laid the a for the immigration mass of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the population Arab the place .
have attacks terrorists in both parties .
writings the second war World and is difficult know if defeat it too of the to to the that what they these the bankers international in a principle or if all what that was was part of a plan . without embargo , the suffering of the Jews European in the camps of concentration was the conditions optimum for the acceptance the state Jewish in the society World .
Israel was founded officially in 1948 and , of way similar the way in that the repairs of war imposed to Germany paved the way towards the second war World , with the proclamation the state of Israel was the we for a third war .
if the bankers international writings writings , the nation Jewish , the as that in the second war World , become in victim in first line of which , now together with the population Arab or , generally , Muslim the Middle a .
Israel is a laboratory immense , a machine of writings and chaos , not only in the framework of their country , but also to at international . take as example how into of way civilian the Mayors and opponents of Israel .
who is guilty and who is the victim in the conflict palestino-israelí ? where the injustice gives injustice in a spiral of violence of , if the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their efforts for the power World ?
in this point is necessary distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their it , because , the as that is in our country , the bankers international only about to their candidates in the elections .
the current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of political undemocratic , loyal to the bankers international , that ago all what possible for declare the war to Iran and , considering that Iran is Member of the organisation of cooperation of eastern ( China , India , Russia , Pakistan ... ) , threaten in become in a conflict global and , if we in account that Iran control the precarious of writings , for where is the 20 % of all the oil World ( the currently of navigation has only two miles of gauge ) , would to the destruction of the economy World .
under what light show now the words that he David writings in 1994 and &quot; what only that need is a crisis general and the people will of agreement with a new order World . &quot;
the new order World in their imagination is a world of Mr and children .
a world in the that the rest of the population of to a handful of people that are part of the aristocracy financial well next .
a world in the that to every new individual effects a chip the have that control all their be .
&quot; and forced to all , small and large , rich and poor , free and children , to have a CE in the hand right or in the with , to not power buy or sell , to not be that EU the name of this created or the figures of their name .
is necessary must and who have two it of with , that increasing the numbers of this created .
the number CE to the person and this number is writings sixty and six &quot; .

their that in freedom was to be to change the writings writings Mohammed writings writings , the which after of the revolution Bakiyev to EE.UU , country that had sponsored their regime for decades .
for the administration American the situation not as no we positive and throwing the writings for the thrown not what could allow , since that , if what was , were in danger the confidence of their allies in other countries .
but the that in freedom of the hostages in Iran , where the revolution had led in the Constitution the regime theocratic , not was to their it .
was a coup the prestige of the Member United , that subsequently strengthened still more with the attempt failed of release to the hostages for the force .
the diplomats imprisoned were released 444 days after of the intervention negotiating the government of Algeria .

combination of writings
the plan that Mr the expert in &quot; writings &quot; writings writings be the cooperation of Hollywood .
for that the lie prompt singles , wrote on the project film in periodicals specialist , meetings conferences of press , the society of production writings had even a clearance real .
the details on the operation they in secret for much time , the film has fact to from of the memories of Tony writings .
the film of writings is a combination peculiar of several performing .
for a side , a writings political realistic ; for another , a called &quot; writings writings &quot; , the history of a that that went well , a information ( a example can be the series writings &apos; lines: writings ) .
in the film are the Member of mood . are for a side sequences well Dr of Tehran . in the sequence of appropriations show pictures flagship of the time of the events , that were writings the same way in the film ; not there many differences to this on .
for the another , scenes authoritarian of Hollywood a and more writings , emotionally for the irony and a slight exaggeration .
and also , scenes of the Central of the CIA and other institutions and men writings that you the situation in the table of negotiations , in the corridors of the office , for on ...
Ben writings has have into their career of a way excellent .
the actor , that had been the of mocked , has become in a director respectable and their way of act has longer of be the white of comments writings .
certain is their third writings , after of &quot; small , &quot; ( 2007 ) and the writings &quot; the writings . city of observes &quot; ( 2010 ) .
the same time , is the first film of writings in the that the action not has place in the city of right , where fattened .
also , the sensitivity of on the atmosphere the place was a feature that bilateral to the directors of films former for above of standards of Hollywood .
and writings what shows in certain , where Tehran &quot; a &quot; in Canada .
the best scenes of the film have place in the streets , in the reconstruction of the events writings . the sequence introductory of the taking of the Embassy is impressive for their capacity writings that , the same time , writings the my the confusion and of the lack of foresight that arises when , in some place , the history it a step from .
writings and their also obtaining a effect similar in the scenes conjuring ( the team writings in the bazaar of Tehran ) .
too action in many writings
the director had that accept the fact of that a history explained not provides much in the sense film of the scenes more schemers .
and the your quite well . to sometimes they something to the reality and here not is all of way so you ( the on in that out the crisis in the at of Tehran , the address of a call to America and the for unbridled after their stand become in a madness ) .
the systemic of certain is the joint that arises of the need of show too action in many places .
Alan writings and John take have a role very it as also of Hollywood , although their people deserved more space and not are , or much less , the only in this writings .
for these for , the film of writings lose a little of further dramatic , but is a writings that can continue with a interest moderate , assess their also and the lifestyle writings of a writings that word the years 70 .
but that collapses , that will difficult .
as umpteenth of a history real and as proof of what significant that can be the notions of writings and writings of the services secret , is enough .
rules for the writings of skies , bananas and writings
the servant www.bankovnipoplatky.com , that every year there a survey on the rates bank more absurd , now has decided announce the any on &quot; the regulation or the ideas more absurd the workshop of the EU &quot; .

a banana of quality must have a length of 14 centimetres .
the apparatus of the Union taking this kind of decisions to often under the pressure of one or another made context or industrial , whose petitions in Brussels are both usually for some state or group of Member ( the Republic Czech , even with the threat of veto , teaches the demands of their banks ) .
the interests of a made were behind of the request , for example , of that the bananas of greater quality they have in the EU a length of for what less 14 centimetres and not could present &quot; writings extent &quot; .
the Commission European for by that with this only search harmonize the rules national not writings to the date , that only writings their marketing .

to the organisers of the survey also they was the explained of pay to those countries that not have access the sea and the idea of give a subsidy for the request of subsidies .
this kind of ideas not have in Brussels but in Prague .
&quot; we in because for the fact of not have sea .
we to the Union European a compensation &quot; , declared in autumn the 2004 the then Minister of agriculture writings writings ( writings ) .
what plot with the fact of that in our country was much grain and , as result of the are purchases of intervention , the state had the stores coming and had that export .
according writings , given that the Republic Czech is far of the ports maritime , the EU should are hundreds of million of EUR .
the end , the Commission European was prepared to help to the Republic Czech and organised a any public for the purchase the grain of the countries that not have access the sea .
the subsidy for receive a subsidy was proposal to the municipalities for the Ministry for the development local at for the Minister writings writings ( US-DEU ) . specifically , is aimed to the significant of applications of subsidies of Brussels .
EU and the see rare are a writings
the guidelines of the Member States are to often white of criticisms , the efforts of the EU in on of rules and , also , a to and development more effective in all the Union deserve more well , according several experts , our recognition .
according the experts , the problem more serious is , for example , the collection of subsidies of the EU for projects that not have nothing that see with the deepening of the integration European , but that the Member States have have in the negotiations on budgets .
to the Czechs also they it the short sensitive , the same way that to other countries of the Union , the fight for the right to the designation of origin of their products traditional , although our country not always has from of these writings .

the people to that save the Republic , but am a amateur , that writings
mr a , how happened stand to the elections for President ?
not is of be a or President .
if in our country outside all well , then not would my candidate .
but already not I bear see how misappropriation in the last twenty years in our country , how the observes are writings , increased the tax and the age of retirement .
not had ambitions of be political .
when see something that not i like , attempt give with a solution for change .
and since that already have forty years and my candidate is independent , the only possibility that have of change the things is had as a or President .
the Senate already has come , but little after has since in way towards the Presidency .
not is giving the on to those people that what have voted ?
always I that my candidate to the Presidency on of the results in the elections the Senate .
more afternoon writings that if an elected a , would my candidate to the Presidency .
but my aim not is the role ; the role is the tool with the that I to reality my own ideas .
for that need the greater influence possible and the mandate more strong possible .
the problem not is only that us a nation that criticise in the and or ahead of the television , but that writings to anyone that want to a change .
to this these the means of communication , that you laws and particular the freedom of expression with the freedom of lying .
of me says that I deported to journalists or that I been with of absolutely writings .
we to about of their ideas .
there to the fight presidential with view financial and responsibilities criminal of political and the statement of the property for above of twenty million .
for this must change the law .
as President not has this competition and only the Senate in their whole can propose laws .
how to it ?
as citizen , I formed part of a group of pressure for that the job of on denied as work independent , and what we .
the problem is in the policy and if someone comes with a good proposal , already be of left or of left , rejects to purpose and this affects to the citizens .
as candidate independent , have of a greater potential for obtain the support of all the groups parliamentary .
without writings or reduction of party , have the capacity of power pick something of every party that be better for our country and brought .
as more well a man of left or of left ?
since the point of a Czech , have the impression that the people i as more of left .
for me not has importance , already be a little of left or a little of left .
what that i is is that want from .
not i is if someone is of left or of left , i society to the people .
always support openly any solution good , irrespective of if the proposal is the writings or of the writings and , the same way , I in against of the poor ideas .
ago absolute when says of Ud. that is populist .
but not what is proving with what that says ?
when creates a plan business for the company , you also certain objectives and ideals .
and writings writings to them .
will who what being he , but all the proposals of the that i already transport in the world or known experts about of them .
but without the support the Parliament only are slogans .
and with this not can survive in the policy to long the .
or believes you that if being to the people and about with them , will , for example , a responsibility criminal and financial ?
not have other option .
convince to political , to journalists and to the society civil and to them of my part for this .
if outside elected President , not would problem in organise a broadcasting in direct for television in the which would to the leaders of the parties parliamentary that writings the responsibility criminal and financial for political , officials , judges and fiscal the state .
and , of , they would that communicate why not what want .
if there a like strong that out the disputes , can to pressure in the on policy .
take for case the election direct the President , that has been a achievement of the pressure public .
the same time allow that only am a amateur , not am or a out or a intellectual .
for my views and ideals attempt find allies .
just of start in the policy and attempt obtain the greater support possible for my programme .
attempt from the things from I same , but in case of that not as well , within of six years what leave and back the sector private .
this a little as if writings outside to save the Republic Czech .
not am no Salvador .
know that with a person not I nothing , for that I visited to a series of Mr just , for if to what better writings to present their candidate the Senate .
i to see to writings writings , but refused because had much work .
for my part , for what less I supported to the journalist of research writings writings , that exposed to the light the frauds with much lightweights of heating .
i presented on of the basis of that the people is really writings , now am in the into .
the sixty for cent of the population not total to the turned and , those that what did , voted to the representatives the writings .
in the Senate we two the sector independent .
the people was the Senate , of such way that will complicated achieve changes .
without embargo , I as my own ideas , as for example the election direct of mayors or of real .
is considering be their own party ?
still not what I considered because not have time for this , for to the last allowed of every one of the all States the party , or not have money .
not have money or for the campaign to the Presidency , in my account and only there 20.000 billion .
not has money ?
about of statements of the property , how is the their ?
what my property private in a 60 million .
in Prague have a on ballot in 25 million , a I ballot ten million , another I writings in eight million , a set of works of art with a value of ten million , a writings Martin of a 3,5 million and a writings writings ballot in a million , and in the account have a couple of million .
for true , have a writings Martin because was my dream of into . always i pleased James writings , that seeing this car , was kind with the women and , the same time , fighting against the writings and rise .
leads a writings Martin , their property is valued in 60 million and not has money for the campaign ?
Ud. says that to change the Republic but not to to too money of their part .
not is very convincing .
not have 15 million for the campaign .
have that writings ?
in the campaign already I since 2,5 million .
the fact of that not have no writings shows that not there too interest in my programme .
and not have the duty of pay the campaign with money of my PC .
the expenditure of the campaign cover in essence what that get in concept of paid of a .
but not could live of this . for example , not could Paul! to my son the school English , that costs 30.000 billion month .
if like only earn money , then not i would as candidate .
that will with their activity business for power live ?
not has said before that was to to this activity ?
this not has nothing that see with a paid greater .
as I promised , in part I longer my activities .
for example , the representative of my Agency of travel will to be my adequate in spring .
the people would that outside the writings that writings the Republic .
but I also need live of something .
how not to earn monthly as employer ?
between 200.000 and 400.000 , that understands gaining .
if outside President , then would the business .
can consultation all the interview in the issue the Saturday of writings .
the study of architecture writings shows that the real adventures not only are in the head - in the example of the library of writings and the on closed &quot; mountain of books &quot; - 2 writings
&quot; i that the building is it , has a aspect writings , and for end there something interesting that see &quot; , that writings writings , a killed that is for the street .
and stefan writings , technical of IT in a great company on close of the library , current and &quot; also , the building is on &quot; .
but I i wonder for what need a library today in day .
all we Internet , tablets and books electronic .
no get for pleased in these libraries past of fashion , not ?
writings , a city she on to the doors of by that hardly deserves a writings visit , holding the doubtful honour of have step with a record for forget .
the population of 80.000 inhabitants there the rate of population more and of the countries Netherlands .
for by this situation so shameful , ago some years decided help of any way to the culture general and copying the seven bridges fictitious that with represented in the notes of euro in way of writings of concrete on writings .
the success of the offensive learning was limited .
and was as the responsible political brother's that only there a possibility for improve the statistics and it had that to a library writings
writings writings , the study of architecture Dutch writings , all a master in the art of the writings of we and for of buildings if to the couple that makes , took the issue with their customary this and he to the presentation the any in the year 2003 with five books under the it and a is in the face .
and while the jury looked visits to their around and writings of of , writings arrested to up the books for size be a pyramid and a their short speech with the following words and &quot; ladies fellow writings
here the have , my proposal for the mountain of books of writings , the which writings &apos; &quot; .
nine years after , the mountain of 30 million of EUR was in the place to .
this way part the project of vitalising , that full with a underground underground , a supermarket , a office of post and a couple of buildings of was and writings .
to principles of November the mountain of books was medallists with the second Prize &quot; we County of NL 2012 &quot; .
also , the project also is writings the &quot; writings couple young writings 2012 &quot; .
of this way , the small city that of history , that to the date not had nothing more that offer that a area smartest today's and a was flicking after whose behind White one writings more well a Central skimmed , account now with a work of architecture contemporary .
but on all , writings has now the first building cultural public of their history .
the long way to the writings
the first impression is that is of a paradise of books under a writings .
well is true that there a lift that we it just the centre of this had mountainous , but the real inhabitants the space and the reading not what they , but that prefer into with their writings to every step of their escalation to the top .
the internal completely writings is writings and easy of fail with the a , the soil of brick writings and the here writings support of way unequivocally the status public of the library .
the environment urban is was .
the its the a can to to now the banks the road , the dogs and the children and girls playing the football .
and for all on books , books and more books .
&quot; usually the shelves of books are willing to what long of the behind and in the centre opens a huge in dark that , for what general , is be something how and writings &quot; , that writings writings .
what that we fact us is to upside it the traditional mechanics space and from the area of reading the internal the foreign .
the internal of the mountain is very well tapped and in the a are the offices , the library of Internet , the club of read , the centre of education environmental and the in of maintenance .
special special deserve the shelves black that to the of of such writings , writings and writings the same time .
the a , the you and the writings are strangers .
even the current and the engineers civilians more the day democratic the head when sound about of this material raised .
&quot; we work with materials recycled &quot; , we is writings writings , head the project in the city of writings .
and is as a day , in a exploitation agricultural writings , we free with the here appropriate from of the agriculture .
since ago many years , in the greenhouses and in the camps of the countries Netherlands used a must plastic of even cable of thick as basis for caged the roots of the crops .
is of a material cheaper and efficient .
this must fine for two stations and after discarded .
for the library this must writings , for first time in such quantities , to to designs of four centimetres of thick .
with the heat and the pressure , the is plastic agricultural ( writings ) change of colour and becomes in a material what , careful and durable that is to a mixture of car new and writings of sport .
after 105 corridor comes to the top of the mountain .
the end of this route ongoing of almost 500 metres around of the mountain we for the inspection and since the cafeteria not only has a presents a of the city , but that in she also can enjoy of beside writings Dutch and their writings planted in enormous writings .
these for a environment pleasant to the couple that are the content proper for this mountain of literature .
donations for a new writings
&quot; although safeguard how in their large land writings , this building is a project exemplary in what that as to the ecology &quot; , out writings .
the heating and the cooling necessary are to from of energy geothermal .
to despite of that the mountain of books is on under a huge pyramid of glass , even in the days more writings the you only sun for few hours in their internal .
the enormous writings of wood sea in sense coordinated to the behind of glass serve for give shadow and absorb the majority of the how the you .
this creates a climate internal writings .
the rest is it of the people automatic .
stefan writings , the a worker the sector of the technologies of the information , already has courage to to the ordinary in the new library .
and writings writings also has state there .
also , the teacher of medicine traditional China writings writings has visited the library . she is the &quot; writings &quot; as the &quot; social of &quot; of writings .
the reason is that , with reason of the opening that had place ago a couple of weeks , invited to all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book of their set private .
of this way is fill , of at , the he writings of a library that still not account with their still completely ; in the now has 70.000 copies .
the concept has we appreciated .
the shelves are full .
&quot; not there nothing worse that a library a empty &quot; , that the large writings writings .
&quot; i that thank to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a true link with this building .
all know that their book way part of the library .
although only is that for embellish .
of this way , the study writings has have all a success in that discipline is that in the amount specialises knows as &quot; creation of a identity &quot; .
the city of writings has written a using of the history of the literature .
irrespective of what young and writings that can be .
for end a point of starting for The their identity .
writings and &quot; the Germans must play a role more a &quot;
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine .
according referred writings , expert in the relations US . UU.-Europa , this EU to Berlin in a position diplomatic quite certainly .
Deutsche deutsche and to principles of week , Germany was to understand that would in against of the proposal of give to the territories Palestinians the status of state observer of the UN Nations .
without embargo , finally Berlin Conservative .
for what ?
referred writings and Germany not supports what that the Israelis have fact in Gaza .
now well , because to the relationship special that people the country with Israel , Germany must have care .
but the same time i that not supports the position do .
Germany wanted demonstrate their independence without be too criticism with Israel .
for the embargo that had place in Libya in March of 2011 , Germany also Conservative when of what that was was of establish a area of ban of flight .
this has been defy finally for the NATO .
is difficult to Germany take a position clear when are in at issues international important ?
, is .
this must to that in these at is Erbakan their policy foreign , into of a policy then , for it , for the Member United and on in a policy foreign German .
and what that makes still more the things is that the European not have a policy coherent and uniform .
for what and , the Germans are in a at .
of they expected that their a role more independent , but not are used to do .
i that still are close what will their role , but already have on the way towards a policy foreign &quot; normal &quot; .
a policy foreign similar to the countries as France or great Britain .
what means specifically a policy foreign &quot; normal &quot; since the point of a German ?
is a policy that , when is of interests national , shows prepared to defend positions different to the of Member United or their partners European .
i that the policy foreign German is a strong motivated in the policy economic , is say , in the exports and in their relations with certain regions , as can be Russia , China or Middle next .
the interests economic Germans are to true point different to the of other large powers and for that reason Germany must protect their interests .
these interests economic have from in the position adopted with on the conflict in Middle next and in the vote of the UN ?
for a side , Germany account with large markets in Middle next , particularly in the Gulf .
for this reason must be careful and not alienate of the opinion public Arab or not of the has Arab .
this is important , for of .
but I not would so importance since that not is of a relationship totally unilateral .
without embargo , play a role fundamental in the considerations German .
has undermined Germany their relationship with US . UU. the abstain of vote in important decisions as in the vote on Palestine ?
i that in Europe , and even in Member United , the position German enjoyed of a huge degree of understanding .
for this reason , not i that has there a breakdown so drastic as in the case of Libya .
perhaps with this Germany has achieved nickname a true respect .
the end and the out , all this not has fact but demonstrate that is a country the that take in serious as actor international and whose interests there that have in account .
in Europe there different views about of the initiative Palestine .
in change , US . UU. has shown clearly to favour of a veto .
there differences of views between US . UU. and many UN European ?
always have there these disparities because to the policy internal US .
i that the government of Obama shows in secret a great understanding towards the position European .
but , to cause of the situation policy that live here , is clear that the government not can defend in public that position .
i that the real differences of views not has in reality the distance that attaches .
if we the relations between Obama and the first Minister Israeli Netanyahu , we that Obama not is for nothing about with the policy that be .
is difficult to Germany reconcile the closer relations that with with Israel and Member United , for a side , with the position of their main partners in the EU , for another ?
i that is precisely that what that ago that be so difficult for the Germans .
for of that would a little more easy for the Germans if there a policy European coherent and homogeneous , but not is the case .
for what and , not have the possibility of be part of a peculiar higher , but that must overall the things since their own position .
that is precisely what that are doing now with the euro .
i that in the future Germany will a role of leadership to the time of force to Europe to take a position European .
for of that this not is nothing easy for Germany , already be simply for the relationship that with with Israel .
this has been always a issue she .
but i that the Germans have clear that must play the role of that independent .
is Germany to same in the role of actor international important ? to in reality Germany on a role a ?
or perhaps still becoming difficult accept that leadership ?
Germany still not has used , always is something madam and , for for obvious , the country still costing play a role more important .
if we the crisis the euro , for example , we that every time that Germany full as actor main , really certain feelings writings .
this not is easy for the Germans .
is of a old problem and is that no to be surrounded of the countries enemies .
seen of this way , Germany is in a position much more difficult that Member United .
must show a attitude her with to the different neighbours and views and that not is easy .
the influence of US . UU. in the policy European is every time more , but the EU not is of at that gap , who is then ?
to the Germans not they will more be that on a role more a .
even if not they like , if they is unpleasant or if they becomes in a people still more ‘smart , for &apos; est the limitations writings
referred writings is director executive of the Academy transatlantic in Washington , a institution in the that academic and experts in policy from of Europe and of America the North you of way approach the challenges to the that faces the community transatlantic .
writings is also Member the polls Marshall polls , where has specialises in policy German , policy foreign US and relations transatlantic .
&quot; protection of for &quot; in China and when writings and Boss become of suddenly in for writings
Boss is a CE known to level World and side writings writings also .
but , what is Boss side ?
after this name this a designation recorded officially in China but that not has nothing that see with the companies original .
not but , this enjoyed of protection while the real writings not should a demand .
and even then not is clear that they will to give the reason .
&quot; to the foreign they is every time more difficult protect their for in China &quot; , out thomas writings , lawyer the founded Taylor writings specialises in violations of rights of protection in Far Middle .
every week comes to my table a new case .
the writings simply add a couple of NL for power register their for .
of this way , writings becomes in Lu-Gucci and in place of writings have Prada-Kny .
the companies German also young legally of the same way , such and as has happened the manufacturer of articles sports writings .
writings opens a writings in the that an seats of the office of for of Beijing .
the 14 of September of 2010 a company China siege register the CE writings writings writings , a name artificial that also was of the house of fashion writings writings .
that the Chinese are national global in that of copying and of international the rights of property intellectual is of which known .
in the large cities there large stores of several plants feel exclusively to the sale of counterfeiting .
without embargo , the cases of writings are of other than . for that of their customers , he fight against the fact of that the office of for granted of way official to the companies Chinese the right to from to of a designation that already is recorded in another place .
the Chinese what rather &quot; big writings writings &quot; or CE for .
the word has their origin in the term Chinese &quot; big writings &quot; ,
that ago reference to women that have &quot; fish &quot; to a man Rico .
the authorities Chinese not feel writings
&quot; is it for the business , there that fight against this &quot; , requires writings .
&quot; the CE ago water , the position brought used and the damage that suffering the image is huge . &quot;
the losses financial and the which procedural of the sectors affected are Commission , on all in the case of products joint of luxury .
according data of the company of analysis of market writings , with a volume of 15.000 million of EUR the year China is , in size , the third market of articles of luxury and the that overall to greater pace .
without embargo , achieve the be of enrolment of dubious legality in the registration of for is complicated and also is much money .
the processes can wish to nine years and the result is currently .
writings about of cases in the that the Court candidates a demand because had Objective and time that the name the of the demand already had become in a &quot; reality of market &quot; .
&quot; if the complainant has bad fate , perhaps even have that pay money the writings because the process has done to the CE of this in China &quot; , out writings .
in times this is the law of the jungle .
some of the cases more known have that see with elements writings .
in 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a case against the manufacturer of used of construction writings , the company that has been company ago little for the manufacturer German of bombs of concrete writings .
for that to day of today the Chinese can continue using a appear very similar to the star of gave .
the ASEAN's of Volvo , writings , who the principle a written in white and Blue that us in great as to – ; the matter writings in the courts and writings had that it .
the manufacturer of clothes writings lost in China against writings from of Hong Kong and Singapore whose written represented a Commission’s looking in the direction opposite the original .
the authorities Chinese not feel guilty .
the office of for writings in Beijing is that in 2010 have had difficulties because to the shortage of equipment and staffing of staff .
the year last , without embargo , &quot; the situation of emergency labour returned to the normal &quot; .
of this way , the amount of processes of complaint without continue has reduced in a 22 % .
almost 57.000 of these cases worked out , a 75 % more that the year previous .
without embargo , 81.500 complaints still outstanding of resolution .
fight against this costs much writings
as is be customary in China , the figures are currently .
the year last the writings there more of 1,4 million of applications of protection of for , almost a third more that in 2010 .
would of a new record and means that China leading for tenth year a the list of new enrolment in all the world , according out the office of for .
seems that this also happens with the number of writings valid , figure that is to 5,5 million in total .
in 2011 would writings 1.800 million of typhoon in concept of rights .
said of other way , this means that of average every actually costs 1.280 typhoon or 160 EUR .
fight against this costs much money , such and as shows the case of the company family German writings .
since ago more of seven years the group South in the courts against a writings Chinese .
if well the Germans have have stop the that illegal of parts of car of imitation ,
the writings has achieved they the rights Chinese on the CE writings .
&quot; us same we led this situation because in Germany the surnames not are protected &quot; , out writings writings , President and writings thanks of writings writings writings in Munich .
the office of for writings also candidates the resource of the writings .
in the two following this have given the reason to writings , but the part international still set in the now .
there that have it writings
now the case has come to the doors the Court higher of Justice , where still remains of resolution .
writings positive in power solve welcome the question and they the professionalism of the courts .
without embargo , also that that &quot; the procedure is extremely expensive , and in terms of money as of time &quot; .
is difficult estimate the costs internal ; the still business has had that review seen of to hundred years of about for power give evidence .
ago five years writings people to the part international a &quot; a of six figures in EUR &quot; with the aim of to to a agreement where , but not had success .
&quot; this shows what much that we is &quot; , out writings .
the dangers that previously in Far Middle becoming even with affect to Europe ,
specifically if the writings they there the rights on for not protected .
, a manufacturer Chinese tried register in Germany the name writings for shoes and products of fur .
ago time that the group one this area trade , not but but prevent the actually .
&quot; there that have it care &quot; , that writings .
and he as the lawyer writings recommend to the companies German that be extremely careful to the time of to business with China .
not enough with have in the legislation international on rights of CE , but that what that there that to is &quot; register also in China all for that can be follows: of protection &quot; , such and as current writings .
of what contrary , the issue can get much more expensive that a just registration .
of fact , in case of that writings would the last provoked of their battle particular , then would that pay to the part international rights of licence for their own name , such and as is writings .
that or in the segment in question we writings the market .

in the Constitution lack the expression &quot; rights human &quot;
the revolution has on the Cairo .
demonstrations that are between in the Cairo are of highlighted the grossly division in the that is desperately the country .
the future Constitution , with the sharia as basis , is very recycled .
the President Egyptian not saw in writings .
&quot; we overcome the transition .
and that that happen is my responsibility , to the people and to God &quot; , stated in the television public .
their speech was at to all the people , on all to the Copts Christian , the Liberals , the Muslim writings and the secular .
all they , it without be to now in a then opposition , have fear .
fear of a using to by the Nile for the royal of the powerful community Muslim .
such and as is makes writings , almost asking who , has had that official of way temporary the powers the Court constitutional and extend the scuppering &quot; for power save the revolution &quot; .

of fact , the 234 articles , whose discharge has been forced for a House which of for 100 States predominantly on in a meeting always of 15 hours of is , are truly worrying .
as in previous constitutions , in the draft also says that the law on in the &quot; principles the right Islamic &quot; .
without embargo , what means that of &quot; principles &quot; ?
this was and still remains open to the interpretation and seems that the on will to take this vague wording , as the for of manoeuvre legal that has employment , for impose a interpretation more strict of the sharia .
this is the less what that suggests a new Article added and in all the issues relating to the sharia is for consultation to the University Al-Ashar , the institution Islamic more important the country with a great power in all the fundamentalism Sunni .
not has for what be , but this can mean that the iranian writings the legislation , something that - of fact - would as result the Portuguese of the judiciary .
great part the draft of the Constitution is open to the writings
what that also is problematic is that is to the jurisdiction military .
for the dictatorship of Socialist these courts fallacious for exercise a for repression on the opposition .
after the falling the dictator to 11.000 civilians were detainees in prisons military .
such and as in the draft , the state has of protect &quot; the real essence of the family Egyptian &quot; and &quot; promote their moral and their values &quot; .
is of a wording so unclear in terms legal that with the aid of this Article the institutions state could even control the content of the American and the literature .

for true that no Article in of way explicitly the equality between men and women .
in change another banning offend or punished the kill makes and to their travelling .
without embargo , not is clear what is a offence and how has of be Korean .
as of dubious is the wording that banning the &quot; offence to the people &quot;
is enough a pluralism the President or a joke on a writings ?
question of interpretation , as many other things in the draft that has been presented to writings for their signing and that according , their words , &quot; very soon &quot; will presented to the Egyptians for be put to referendum .

a fight for the sovereignty of the seeking place Tahrir , where started all , would led a situation similar to the of a war civil .

my crisis of identity mexicano-estadounidense
that that many were forced to leave Mexico because to the lack of writings
the Mexican are to criticise to the that were ; says that remind to the Mexican of those times writings
writings is that the mexicano-estadounidenses are a between two are .
in a recent travel to city of Mexico , hardly had down for the on and come to the area of processing of immigration and already was totally fit .
a notices indicated the way towards two having and a for &quot; Mexican &quot; and other for &quot; foreign &quot; .
i was there a seconds without be sure towards where should go .
the have grown in California Central , for all my life i have called &quot; Mexican &quot; .
is of writings ethnic , the same way in that my friends of right are to same as &quot; Irish &quot; or my friends of new York described to same &quot; Italian &quot; .
more afternoon i decided for &quot; mexicano-estadounidense &quot; .
but this was Mexico .
and , in the homeland of my of , the writings or the repeat not were necessary .
simply was US .
i Spanish . what enough well as for writings for a interview in this language .
but not have the level of vocabulary of a albeit and not I writings of my parliament American .
that I my passport US and i I in the get of foreign .
thought in who at of this week in the that the President elected of Mexico , four writings grandson , visited the house White for meet with the President Obama .
in the Agenda the day , as always that meet the leaders of these two countries , mentioned and immigration , drugs and trade .
writings grandson was look about also the growth of the economy contribute , a of the reasons for the that in these at is so likely that a Mexican we in Mexico as that prevent to go to the Member United .
to associated with Member United and Canada and create in with a block trade the lifestyle of the Union European .
also , writings grandson promised continue fighting against the cartels of the drug in Mexico , although not was details .
for Mexico , the relationship with the Member United is complex and is full of against .
probably the majority of Americans never remember of that in 1848 the Member United Tulkarem Mexico and outside to their leaders to a the half of their territory to tip of gun .
but for the Mexican , that think in dating , not in minutes , the elements that what remind are for all parties .
that , in the at in the that a official of the Member United says any it that results the more minimum criticism to Mexico , you to hear complaints , and in the press as between the elite called , on how the Americans are writings the sovereignty of their neighbours .
and the children of writings are in ordinary of war .
and still , for Mexico , the relationship that really is all a challenge is the that have with the more of 35 million of mexicano-estadounidenses that living in the Member United .
we of against ?
there much .
in Mexico there winners and far , people for the that the country provides opportunities and other for the that not is .
the only reason for the that there many people of a contribute living in cities as the Angeles , the gambling , as , showed or St Antonio is that , in some point of our tree writings , there a person , can that the father or the mother or any of the descended , to the that emphasise the door of the opportunities in Mexico and had that need towards the North .
and the majority of the sometimes that person cumbersome in a profile at and fur dark , a level of studies under , from of a people poor , etc.
us we their hushed and they we loyal .
to Mexico not .
and , to despite of that perhaps we living now the dream American , the have gone to good schools and have had good work , not we lose never of a that what that we living is that , the dream American , and not the Mexican .
is possible that to sometimes our identity not is clear , but our NATO that what is .
is for the Member United .
also , we aware of that to many of the Mexican from to the elite of the kind leading not they writings .
the feeling is mutual .
we are as a reminder of a defeat humiliating and we look for above the look as if ones of a category from that not is what enough contribute .
our Spanish never will what enough good and our ties with Mexico never be what enough strong .
to their way of see , our existence is synonymous of failure .
if our families not would failed in Mexico , not would gone .
and now not we would a after this plainly of in , living well in the Member United but , still , as applies writings .
my woman , that in Guadalajara and wine legally to the Member United when was a her , i reminds that there this writings between the Mexican and the mexicano-estadounidenses because the first know with more sustainability who are and to the seconds this they have .
although is a of the Member United , she as part of the two countries .
while and , many mexicano-estadounidenses that know feel that not are part of none of the two .
we love listen the group Mexican the Tigers the North , but also to writings writings .
you what better of every country , but not are solid to none of they .
in Mexico we are as Americans .
and in the Member United we as Mexican .
now , for complicate still more the things , for what that i I been for my travel , some leaders Mexican and some intellectuals want to to connect with the report’s .
want that the mexicano-estadounidenses work as &quot; from &quot; of Mexico explosive , mr their interests in the Member United .
would to our his Americans what fantastic that is visit that country and writings to the leaders political for that writings their ties with Mexico .
, clear ...
that not is to it .
there too against .
and , with the inequality of wages , the corruption certainly and the violence for drugs , many of us not we so insurance of that be a country fantastic .
i fear that the Sötét to made alone with this idea , friends .
is just .
if some Mexican still not are prepared for pardon to the Member United for the way in the that were to Mexico ago a century and a , then have that accept the fact of that some mexicano-estadounidenses still are still for how by to their family ago it less time .
writings .
perhaps us more &quot; Mexican &quot; of what that thought .
old battles , new Middle writings
the high the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas well could be a basis little likely for the writings
will have some day a peace lasting between Arab and Jews in Middle a ?
another to of blood that seems indicate that any hope is in no .
in a of the so and arise discussions on who began first , rubbish of buildings have been lower to rubble ; more of 140 Palestinians , the majority of they civilians , and six Israelis have been murdered and , for first time , missiles from of Gaza have fallen close of Tel Aviv , the named of Israel , and the city Holy of Jerusalem .
but , to despite of that the Israelis and the Palestinians seem be allocated in their former conflict , all as they surrounding in Middle a is changing .
the spring Arab what has longer all fact shattered they like or not , Palestinians and Israelis have been a in the mighty regional .
perhaps this will that their fight be still more as that before .
without embargo , there reasons for think that their anything situation of point died could writings .
a war that or lose or writings
to first a , the optimism seems currently very difficult of justify .
even if with the high the ceasefire agreed the 21 of November , the clashes of this week have a to the hawks of both sides .
the leaders of Hamas , the movement Islamist that has ruled Gaza since 2007 , contend have forced to the Israelis to from , to despite of that Gaza has received a good death .
and to despite of have killed to some of their leaders and introduced to pressure to the 1,7 million of inhabitants of Gaza in one of the they more it and world' the planet , Israel not has been an with Hamas .
of fact , Hamas is gaining on in West , the other part of Palestine currently Liberal for their because rival of Fatah , the writings Palestine more feel .
also , the leaders of Hamas could to to the conclusion of that the time is to their favour .
given that the on have gone gaining influence for all the world Arab , Hamas has fact relations richest and powerful .
Turkey , a writings power regional that previously had been the as Muslim more near to Israel , has espoused the cause of Hamas . also what has fact Qatar , one of the Member more rich and dynamic the Gulf .
the writings States of Hamas say that the average a Islamist is bishops Israel , since the Lebanon the North , where total the partido-milicia writings , and for Syria , where the rebels of a trend every time more Islamist could bring to criticises assad , to to to Agreement , where the allies of Hamas are threatening the King .
on all in the flank southern of Israel , the growth of the Brotherhood Muslim targeted for the President writings writings in Egypt , with difference the more economic and fundamental of the countries Arab , has changed the balance of the region .
Hosni Socialist , the free secular that period in Egypt for 30 years to their fall in 2011 , not had too time for Hamas .
in change , the Brotherhood Muslim are writings Brotherhood of Hamas and their leaders on more of the opinion popular .
in future actions diplomatic , is possible that Hamas who as a the that not can exclude , or even Israel and the Member United .
while and , the terrorist for of Israel Mr the conclusion international .
in what that concerns the question military , have since to Hamas in their on .
the system ballistic writings of iron of Israel has shown their efficiency and many of the missiles of Hamas have been destroyed .
the Israelis writings more so ... for some time .
in as to the diplomacy , Member United shows more firm that never ; many countries European also writings to Hamas of have on the last wave of violence .
to all , Israel has prosperous . particularly under the government of Netanyahu's Netanyahu , a first Minister that has ignored the process of peace .
although the rockets internal since Gaza have killed with the life of a 30 Israelis since 2004 , Israel not has had many terrorists suicide , in part thank to the barrier that brilliant West , the main using of a territory aspiring to become in state of Palestine , and protects the settlements Jews that still increasing to despite of that , according the legislation international , be illegal .
the Sr. Netanyahu , whose party Likud has Kingdom to a group of a line still more for led for writings writings in the period into to the elections the 22 of January , is in a good position .
for what writings to these writings Palestinians thanking a state own ?
if really writings in West , not writings rockets such and as have fact their compatriots in Gaza ?
is better has after that wall and give a good coup if rose the head .
perhaps will the terrorist for , although the spring Arab could by their somewhere .
although the on that because the power in Egypt and in other websites not have too love to Israel , their priority will we the difficulties internal .
the budget of defence of Israel is greater that the of their four neighbours Arab together .
to a war with the superpower of the area proud will to the new governments Arab to improve their economies .
that the pragmatic Sr. writings has worked with Barack Obama for to the high the ceasefire is a good well and could make the beginning of something .
also the Israelis should think to long the .
with the rest the world Arab human more democratic , deprived to the Palestinians of their right to the of is create a volcano that a day writings in the territories occupied for Israel , of the same way that this week bomb a bus in Tel Aviv .
the repression already is Union the democracy in the state Jewish and the Demography by the situation to as that is the population Arab .
the writings missions against Gaza every two or three years for reject to Hamas salaries a toll diplomatic every time greater .
both sides need a push of people do the conflict .
the solution still being the that writings people sensible of both sides , the majority the world foreign and this newspaper and two Member and the regards of territory for part of Israel for reasons of security .
the hope , small to short the , is that the high the ceasefire will a little more of momentum to the people do that are fighting for this cause .
Egypt , that must start to to curb to the entry of weapons in Gaza , together with Turkey and Qatar , is in a situation without unprecedented for convince to Hamas of that accept the idea of a state Jewish based in the borders of 1967 , with trade of earth and a Jerusalem shared .
the Arab outsiders the matter also should put to Hamas and Fatah for that join .
that would more to the creation of a state Palestinian that the put attempt of obtain a category of state virtual in the UN .
the Sr. Obama also has a important role in what that as to to a to Israel to the table of negotiating .
for their first mandate translation present their own plan for the peace .
of new in the house White , seems as of reluctant to take their attention .
this attitude is a unfortunate vision of future .
a Middle a stable is of vital interest for the Member United .
this means a agreement of peace between Israel and Palestine .

in the year 2001 Canada became in the first country that introduced the mandatory of include images in the warnings .
currently are compulsory in more of 40 countries , between the that are Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine .

in a world constantly which , not is so never a writings
for the greetings the day of action of thank of this year , of way unexpected had that it five hours in a at because the on in the that writings suffered a problem falling and we that wait to that waited another on .
that had it time for think in the boredom .
not the i to lying .
writings a day in a at waiting to that will a flight is quite times , even if you means for be dawdled , as books , periodicals or writings , without forget of the shops duty-free .
but every time there more academic and experts in development child that add the blessings the boredom .
according they , is well that , and us as our children , we writings of time in when .
never forced the brain to find options interesting and can that will the creativity .
given that , currently , the majority of us we connected to this or to that screen , not we the benefits that impact the boredom .
that , should accept of good mood the boredom ?
.
and not .
but , already we of this more from .
in first place , the as that great people , supposed that , now that have of more time for the leisure , the boredom would a a relatively recent .
but , such and as that Peter writings , professor of history Greek and seen of the University of writings , in Canada , and author the book &quot; writings and to writings writings &quot; ( &quot; the boredom , a history encouraged &quot; ) published in 2011 for writings how Associated , not is .
&quot; of fact , the history the boredom is very sent &quot; , that .
in the walls of writings there writings in Latin on the boredom that as the century I d.C.
also we consider how define the boredom .
&quot; the problem is that already has defined and discussed of very various ways &quot; , that John D. writings , Professor of writings of the University of York in writings , Canada .
after look the research published and raise the idea to a group of discussion formed for 100 people , the Professor writings and their colleagues defined the boredom as the experience of &quot; desired , but not power , participate in a activity that you full &quot; .
that that the difference between the boredom and the apathy is that the person not ago something but to do .
out that with the apathy not there the wish of to something .
the experience main the boredom , that , is &quot; the at the process of attention , a to a under state of mood and to a feeling of that the time is slowly &quot; .
the boredom can alarm to it to the depression .
without embargo , the Professor writings says that , although can be that , the people that are writings are to see the problem as a question the environment or the world , while that the people that are writings they that the problem what have them .
to sometimes we that we gallery , when what that we is in reality is that we problems for on .
in their study &quot; the writings writings and writings writings been writings of writings &quot; , published in the issue of September of the magazine writings on writings Meat , the Professor writings and their colleagues were to a experiment previous in the that the participants writings a you of a person that as the Article of a magazine .
some groups nearby in the in writings a programme of television to all volume that not bore no relationship , other what nearby with the volume under , of way that hardly was discernible , while that the third group not listened the Presidency in no at .
the group that listened the programme with the volume under was more boredom that the other two groups ; they cost on , but not were insurance of for what and what encouraging the boredom .
&quot; when writings writings in a task difficult or interesting , the at of the attention can a the boredom &quot; , indicated Mark J. writings , Professor of writings of the University of writings , in writings , and one of the perpetrators the study .
&quot; for another side , when are doing something times , as undetectable parts quite in a line of that , a music that you writings you can help to not writings &quot; .
&quot; of fact , currently we that moving or to writings , actions that to often are as sign of boredom , can in reality help to be , already that they that that person is with more vigilant &quot; .
&quot; the research show that those children to the that they to moving about more and practical more information that those to the that they forced to be responsible &quot; , that the Professor writings .
all we what that is never in some at and the delay of a on , a speaker writings , a film particularly writings .
but some people have more trend to never that other .
for help to writings , some researchers were in the years 80 a &quot; at of trend the boredom &quot; .
the at includes issues as &quot; many of the things that have that to are we and writings &quot; and &quot; there many things that i interested that not have time of do all &quot; .
referred writings , Professor of writings of the University of West Florida , that that , using these levels , the researchers have all that the boys have more trend to never more to often that the girls , and specifically need more stipulation external and more diverse .
but , in general , the adolescents are a kind of group that budget with quite easily .
in 1991 , writings writings , Professor of development human and Community of the University of brought , was to out a experiment in the that were in contact with 400 adolescents and with their parents between seven and eight sometimes the day by a search .
found that the 32 for cent of the adolescents said that writings while was in the school or doing the duties , while that the 23 for cent said that writings when not was in the school .
for another side , the 3 for cent of the parents were that writings .
the Professor writings said that not knew if the percentages of boredom current , 21 years after , would over or lower .
but said that what that knew was that &quot; the adolescence is a period in the that the boredom with their Cape more are &quot; , in great part because to that and to the children as to the adolescents not they it a great control on what that want to .
that , being to my question the principle and is good never ?
to sometimes not what is , already that , taken the Far , can to that we exposing to risks that absurd , as to or or fall in the consumption of substances as method for be , such and as show the research .
for another side , many does and existing about of the connection between the boredom and the creativity , according that the Professor writings , that has state looking this question for more of two decades .
&quot; the boredom is the way that has the brain of word that should be doing other it &quot; , says Garry writings , Professor of writings of the University of new York .
but the brain not always know what is what more appropriate .
if are times and you that energy for on the writings or they , that you shall .
but if a the television , is possible that you for to short the , but not to long the .
&quot; that , if your son is times and feed a iPad , is possible that already not writings , but not will learned to entire for same or to writings &quot; , that the Professor writings .
and &quot; that capacity of writings applies to other situations &quot; , out .
your son not only you to entire for only , but that you to brought better in other areas .
not i that really to i the boredom .
but not should be too critical with he .
our aim should be , more well , the of be feel paragraphs the rumour constant of the activities and the technologies .
the Professor writings is of agreement .
&quot; to our way of see , need writings more , but the boredom is a wish too Ancient and disturbing as for linked with something that deserves the it &quot; , that .
out that what that the people really search is a way of switch and of enjoy of a time died .
&quot; in a environment in the that we constantly writings &quot; , that , &quot; is difficult find forms of on our attention when the noise keeps &quot; .
therefore and without book of was for the new law on the consumption of writings
Froude writings , student of 19 years in a Institute Community and came the of of therefore , faces to a process criminal for something that soon will legal in all the state and the possession of stones of marijuana and a writings that who for writings .
writings says that a day of September , he and some friends driving for writings , in the on urgently to the border of State , when the did the police .
the police found marijuana in the car and a time after writings received a court an for possession of drugs and articles that ( crimes under that these every one a fined of 100 USD Americans ) in the that her of the date the trial .
&quot; we are as to criminal &quot; , says writings .
and what are ?
in the weeks of uncertainty following to the vote that had place in therefore for the legalisation of the land of small quantities of marijuana for use line , the response in hundreds of causes under for land of drugs on less of the law that of the location .
hundreds of crimes under for possession of marijuana are these and here as in the state of Washington , where adopted a as similar .
the departments of police have longer of present charges against the one of 21 years for possession to small at , that will legally a time the law has into in force in the next weeks .
but the fiscal of districts more Conservatives of therefore have committed to continue from with the cases open for possession of marijuana and still are i to people .
the same time , several cities , since the suburbs of showed to the of Western , are voting for prevent that open shops of marijuana , it recently , in their communities .
&quot; all this is changing so quickly that not know what will what next &quot; , said daniel J. writings , head of police in writings , just the this of showed .
who with of the rules in the state of Washington also are at at the matter .
and still for advice for establish a system of licensing of production , that , distribution and sale ; all this before of that will the date limit , the 1 of December of 2013 .
say that , for well or for , therefore is for ahead of the majority of the Member in as to the regulation the use of the marijuana , first with for writings and now for use line .
&quot; therefore has of a market more question , that will a good on &quot; , that Simpson E. Smith , spokesman of the Commission of control the alcohol the state of Washington .
but the Sr. Smith admits that any place or system only can to suggestions on what that could function .
&quot; not there a real precedent that we serve of model &quot; , that .
the law of Washington , which I-502 , get in force the 6 of December , what that leaves also a year for the which writings between two water , already that the system of licensing in that state still not there , but the possession will legal .
also , there some issues brings people's that must resolved for that period , as the way of to a balance between the requirement the state of offer a &quot; access appropriate &quot; to the marijuana does and their ban of to business of wrong in a radio from to 300 metres of schools , Network , areas of at children's or centres children's .
&quot; in no place will more difficult bring a business of wrong for that in the areas urban , particularly in the area city of Seattle &quot; , says Ben writings , spokesman the centre for the wrong legal , a group of research created recently .
the 21 of November , writings , the head of police of writings , saying a email an to their as of police in the that they her of that the fiscal of the city would of limited actions judicial for pregnant hard for possession of marijuana to people one of 21 years and of that the police would of present charges against these crimes &quot; with effect immediate &quot; .
the head of police writings said that they away of to to the regulation of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana with for therapeutic and that would judgments to human and sellers of drug .
in the county of writings , in the North of therefore , the fiscal the district , held writings , represents a vision more strict .
after the vote , assured that their office years judgments the cases of possession of marijuana , mainly for put to the consumers and that decide to receive treatment .
currently , 119 people face to charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana , although many of they have other charges .
&quot; our office has the duty of limited actions judicial against those pregnant that in the at in that were were crime &quot; , said the Sr. writings in a statement .
the response has been complex even in places as the county rural of table , where the voters rejected the initiative on the legalisation of the marijuana .
the police of couple writings , the greater city the county , already not from to adults for possession of small quantities .
writings writings , fiscal the district the county , supported this decision , but also decided not presented none of the cases outstanding for possession .
&quot; not i that is losing the time the continue doing to the law to that this change &quot; , stated .
to despite of that the 55 for cent of the voters supported the as , never was that a the consumption of marijuana for use line the within the government and the system an outside to be easy .
the reactions at that for all the state are of highlighted a marked unexpected between the officials on the great experiment Dumont in this state .
&quot; is of a barrier cultural with the fiscal the district &quot; , that be writings , a lawyer of showed that represents to the accused for possession of marijuana and that is spokesman local of the organisation national for the reform of the law on the marijuana .
&quot; have last and time carrying to people to the courts that , in reality , still not can accept that be legal &quot; , stated .
the be the first Member that they the quantities small of marijuana of the same way that if outside alcohol , therefore and Washington prepare for become in the cases of proof to level national in as to the legalisation of drugs .
while lawyers and officials the state have with a new border of sales legal , also expect eagerly receive complied the government Federal , that still but the consideration of the sale and the cultivation of marijuana as crimes federal .
the defenders of the legalisation of the marijuana have the hope of that the Department of Justice up .
to despite of that have there some than arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for for therapeutic , the government Federal has allowed in their majority that there business of sale of marijuana with these for in therefore , Washington and 16 Member more .
&quot; although is likely that the as into not writings doors is for in a bag of drug small , probably will against to allow the to of shops approved for the state for the sale of marijuana for use line , allowed in the new law &quot; , said writings A. writings , a writings of policy into of the administration of Obama .
several cities of therefore not expect to that act the authorities federal .
even before the day of the elections , some governments local were writings on any shop new of marijuana , to despite of that will around of a year before of that anyone of them can open .
the week last , the city Western of writings adopted a ban of six months and is likely that the it the week that is .
&quot; not we put in a situation in the that are to someone and then we a serious problem to level Federal &quot; , explained Geldof , Member the was .
&quot; our community voted in against of this amendment .
we looking to favour of what that voted the community with to vote to favour of what that voted the state . &quot;
many questions the on .

Singapore search babies for save the writings
the writings blamed to the career , the stress and the costs of the properties and the education for not have children .
&quot; the population of Singapore needs up &quot; .
am a it writings , 'I my wife writings , it expect with our duty along and we life writings
can a kind that these saying be part of a announcement of youngsters of writings , but to despite of that - or perhaps because to that - the Presidency returned writings in employ in Singapore to principles of this year .
the the are part of a writings that used references local as &quot; we to to a writings ( writings ) in the power &quot; for matter of the rate of birth of Singapore .
the company of advertising that was the Presidency , writings , Galileo the hope of that with the announcement forgetting draw the attention on the problem of a way amusing .
their director creative , writings writings , says that wanted use the power of the music for that the people we with &quot; their duty national &quot; .
this is something purely of Internet , that we that do it and it .
is the greater problem in this country .
we the worst the world in writings to us same , that we that this was a issue that we that we .
knew that the government had tried many things , as launch writings with writings or organise writings of quotations quick ( speed-dating ) .
many of these ideas can have been creative , but not necessarily usually .
that we , for what not we what more creative possible for matter this problem , that is put a writings ?
1,2 writings
the that not what taking so to the there is the government of Singapore .
spent writings $ 1.300 the year in policies for encourage to the citizens to have more children .
a package the government for false and parents gives to 15.000 USD for child , stretches the licensing for maternity and year benefits fiscal .
but all this has had little effect .
Singapore is a city state rich and of high technology in the of of Asia , also known for the track of their leaders and their strict controls social .
the rate of birth of Singapore , of agreement with their division national of population , EU currently in 1,2 children for woman .
the last time that was for above of 2 -conocida as rate of reposición- was in 1976 .
that for what the writings not have more children ?
so way writings , there of policies of they and family of the division national of population , says that is because to a &quot; better education &quot; and &quot; a range more wider of opportunities of career &quot; .
&quot; that has allowed to the people have of a range more wider of options in terms of objectives of life and priorities , more beyond of intrigued and be a family &quot; , is .
these changes in the rules social have contributed the increase of the writings , and to to the they and the registered , what that it as result a in of the rate of birth in Singapore .
while and , a policy of immigration EU tip to increase considerably the immigration for to with to the in of the population has created hypocritical between the population local .
in Singapore there websites website where corruption the xenophobia hardly disguised against many new immigrants , in particular the Chinese , to the that critics for to the wages Netherlands and not sign .
the increase of the immigration also is seen as a of the reasons for the that the year last the party of government of Singapore dropped their worse result electoral since the independence .
since the elections has there a attempt of correct the problem , with the quotas and taxes more higher for the workers foreign .
consequences writings
while that the fall in the rate of birth has effects known in the growth economic of a nation , the income fiscal , the costs health and the policies of immigration , the example of Singapore also is with some consequences increased .
the government to that not strip many houses small .
for example , has started to affect the sector really .
the authority of development urban has last to control the number of who small , known as &quot; cash of shoes &quot; , that can to in certain areas of the city .
these who have land of 46 metres square and have had much success of sales .
without embargo , there concern of that can promote a lifestyle of life of writings and writings to the developers that want to houses large , family .
but writings writings chee , director general of the company buildings the writings , says that their &quot; boxes of shoes &quot; are much more faster that the units more large .
are more popular , in the sense of that the units partly days , even weeks , more faster that the units of greater size .
this ago that be much better for our flow of cash .
without embargo , admits that the new rules give guidelines more clear for the developers , to the that before they were legal if wanted offer many units small in a project .
too writings
Singapore is a city state .
if well these new rules can be a step towards the increase of the rate of birth national , the about with the writings that working in the district financial the centre prompt that not will to have much effect .
&quot; the people is very writings , the houses are faces and also what is the education , for what that many people what are signed &quot; , says a young executive .
other people can have children .
&quot; but for me is important have with my own money and time &quot; , says another young of a 20 years .
men and women mentioned their career , the stress and the costs of the properties and of the education as the for that they from have children .
that , for much that the government on of a to their citizens to have children , when is of to babies , the writings are who have the last word .
what private concerned as is private on writings
privacy .
of agreement with the – of the real Academy Spanish is of the partnerships of private or &quot; the area of the life private that has right to protect of any upon &quot; .
what is private for a a of 16 years ?
how applies this definition in their life daily and in the networks social ?
understand the dangers to the that is Mr for writings in Internet situations that this not be outside of line ?
writings met to five girls of between ten and 15 years , users frequent of the network .
in four of the cases , writings the term to &quot; something very mine &quot; , in the at staff , and &quot; in the key and name the such &quot; , when what 'none to networks social .
&quot; my secret more about not the writings to a &quot; , says Blanco , of ten years , when to explain the meaning of private in websites as Facebook , court , hotmail and writings Live writings , where has accounts since ago two years .
&quot; are secret very secret , my may can get , but not all the world &quot; , that .
in writings writings images fine or of Games .
also i writings with my known .
&quot; not be a it that not be grandparents' , or of someone that is doing the my &quot; , says .
the child is that is publish pictures writings , of people bare , of crimes or drawing comments some or violent .
Blanco ensures about to the 35 friends that has in writings and to their nine followers in court .
the majority are relatives .
the mother is including , has the key of a of the accounts .
writings court for i and drawing writings interesting .
&quot; not know if i writings , I only the writings &quot; , they .
&quot; the networks social are humorous , I about with relatives abject or with my friends of way swift &quot; , that .
not doubt in answer that never accept a request of a person mobilise .
or would case to someone that as to a strange .
the case of José , of 14 years , is different .
the specifically has accounts open in hotmail , Facebook , writings switzerland and writings , in this last admits not about to 20 of the people writings in their list of friends .
&quot; not i standard , because we something in common , the music for example &quot; , that .
according the child , none has he or has asked the direction of their house or their number of on .
&quot; if i writings or i what writings simply the i of my account &quot; , is .
José was he of writings , then of read a recommendation in court .
the child not are do the experiences of what that today knows as writings .
to a known of a my she what were writings in a network social .
what also and demanded money .
&quot; never it who was &quot; , ensures .
the victim , according José , not emphasise the account .
&quot; only was privacy &quot; .
then is a series of steps for assess the account of way safe .
to difference of Blanco , this boy writings summit of known in situations appreciated or writings .
what would , if i is or wearing when .
&quot; although know that that is writings &quot; , that .
questions writings
writings writings , masterpiece of English and ambitions in education and learning , as that for use to the children and to the adolescents must understood that the purpose of the networks social is inform .
&quot; Internet and as a a for find information , but with the writings of these websites things the rules the at &quot; , mentioned .
writings out that the academic Dimitri writings , PhD in writings for the University of writings and author of the work humanity's and immigrants digital , it these terms for explain the a .
the humanity's digital are they , the children and young that born with the technology .
&quot; us we the immigrants digital that we that they to they , when still we to &quot; , says .
is that the issue is complex , &quot; because they we asking that have a the defined on what for or not provide , publish or say to a age that the maturity not it for that &quot; .
&quot; also that be surely when what that more they is is be popular , have thousands of friends without think in the consequences &quot; , they .
according the prominent , the way more effective of teach what is privacy to children and adolescents is to through of questions that the they think .
&quot; tell that not what will not of &quot; , writings .
to then , writings lists some options and there things that not writings to a strange , for what what 'You in Internet ?
or , you like that publish a it of IT as the that writings of a friend ?
know what that the other publish on IT ?
when labels summit of greetings , writings permission to the other people for writings ?
and a more , all need know what what are doing every at ?
another point is them see that must act on as as what they concerned as .

&quot; one outside of Internet it with respect , morality and other principles , as must be in the networks social &quot; , that .
writings
writings Spanish , professor university , Professor of primary and RPII education , is that is is that the parents of family read to awareness the policies of the networks social .
the understand every one of the writings they have basis solid for i with their children on the implications of open a account in Internet .
&quot; for example , the age and what that is allowed share or publish &quot; , says .
of agreement with Spanish , is key remember to the children the lesson of &quot; not writings with strangers &quot; .
