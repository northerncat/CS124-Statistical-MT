the children overweight from in their majority of families with a lifestyle of life that not is healthy , according from of research current .
again to demonstrate what is the importance the environment where overall for a development healthy of the person , so as the models that serve of reference .
in the table , the children fawn fuel , example , of pressed the least with the double of often that the children of families with weight normal .

&quot; only the half of the children fawn have would that have five lunches cares according the regime : Breakfast , lunch , food , fawn and dinner , that is a of the conditions in for a fawn healthy &quot; , other one of the results of the survey .
Breakfast but with fawn for fawn

in keeping , not however , only the 23 % of the families of schoolchildren fawn to the same time .
in the majority of the families , every one fawn only .
but what worst was be that in the 10 % of the who not fawn nothing .
the Breakfast is , however , the basis of a fawn daily right .
the study shows that in the families of children overweight consume with very more often the fawn potatoes fawn .
almost all - regardless the weight - they to on fawn fawn ( 70 % ) .
rule general do sport more the 40 % of the children fawn , however , expression their parents this result reduces to least of the half , only the 15 % .
fawn your fawn
the next stage the study fawn that the fawn elected ( 204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools ) fawn their own which to from of all the at possible according their tastes and views .
&quot; the preference food of the children Czech in age percentage between the 12 and 15 years , since the point of view of a food healthy , are very removed of what ideal . &quot;
between their food records are the fawn , the meat and the fawn
&quot; is on all alarming the popularity of the fawn fawn &quot; , by in the report end the study .
as food main has the Palma the fawn and you still of close the meat of subsiding .
virtually , the children reject always the fawn and the will the fish and the I is very under .
change to habits fawn
the same time , the study shows that the children are prepared to change their habits food if receive the information fair .
&quot; in the group of control of the participants in the study , that fawn the fawn after of end the programme of prevention &quot; the obesity not is a fawn &quot; , was in many cases a change important to favour of the principles of a food healthy &quot; , as in the results the study .
is the attention , example , what as to the fawn fawn , where many children fawn to fawn the water normal and aware .
the children also fawn with more often in the fawn the meat of subsiding and the fish for the food main and fawn the consumption of food fresh and the derivatives of fawn .
the fawn has of be also a good psychologist , maintain the fawn
in the Article fawn , how about the fawn , already I fawn a little of that the lessons initial already were quite fawn .
not had not idea of how would for .
conferences of three professionals the fawn , how tight to eventual problem and , also , a seminar on how works in the world the spectacle .
and will worst .
as more close are the examinations end , more information and tasks practices we fawn
and although the course develops every Saturday and Sunday , already not is a fawn .
we time we examined with the there , fawn , ( in the course not there no man ) on how tight to the woman that not has a fawn perfect .
and so is the great majority .
someone is fawn , someone has a on fawn the fawn right and someone suffering obesity .
the fawn has of know arise fawn a shoulders fawn , fawn a bottleneck or fawn the fawn fawn
we have given certain noticed on how to i the body of women the kind of fawn NO , of fawn and fawn enormous but fawn close and the same time not fawn of a way too fawn
if , example , the difference between the fawn and the fawn is so that the skirt or the trousers not fawn , is the it done fawn the least a paper of manipulated fawn to measure .
doubt not fawn , because the clothes that where perfectly is fawn .
with a skirt to measure relieved a better that with a that not for of ! , fawn , fawn in the fawn , etc.
the body fawn can allow tight clothes with fawn , fawn , fawn or fawn .
there certainly many types of information various and of bodies , so that am readjust of that have of whole the week for to order in my head whole this information .
and even so , I fear that with the task fawn , already have more that of too .
to every participant in the course you have allocated two famous , to the that must solutions two fawn : one for the day and another for the night .
there that have in account the aspect current , the lifestyle of fashionable that fawn to the person in question .
I has fawn &quot; tight &quot; to fawn Kerr , perhaps the fawn of the campaign of victory &apos; at fawn .
out within , for me is a better that , example , fawn fawn or fawn fawn , that recently will fawn a hundred double ( favour , have in account the excessive ) , or the fawn fawn fawn .
the overalls we that fawn of the weeklies or fawn in Internet and fawn , for after fawn wholeheartedly .
the fawn , that is as is the result completely , this also our lifestyle personal and our relationship with the design fawn .
is important also think in the part fawn the fawn .
the fawn , therefore , not fawn only physically , but that also taken , example , of the pages of products in the weeklies ( of subjects specific , as trends , fawn , coats , etc. ) .
of all this we spoke the fawn and leather fawn .
but all this already is for the Sunday .
the fawn has of have a vision global .
the three invited specialists him the conference the Saturday with information on all kind of bodies .
the fawn fawn fawn , the leather of fashionable fawn fawn and the fawn of fashionable Ben fawn .
fawn we reminded that the fashionable is a illusion and the fawn should fawn from party to this .
and a good fawn know work with a same fawn of tight of forms various .
the fawn is , in this case , fundamental .
so , the such fawn ( or as say in English , trench-coat ) can tight to what hidden with fawn and fawn , but also it for tight the body he with shoes of fawn and fawn as if it in reality a clothing .
or well enough fawn and higher the bottleneck for obtain a image completely different .
&quot; fawn with this &quot; , we stressed .
what that more fawn is the next Council : &quot; for start to work , ago lack that first fawn all the rules &quot; .
&quot; then already Now fawn &quot; , said fawn .
end I is clear what fawn all these keep , what being with what , what , if then is that in the weeklies of fashionable we we results different .
that about of the fawn .
thank the fawn Ben , know that a fawn has that have more types of clothes in the reserve of the that to fawn .
so , for a history of fashionable that have ten pages ( therefore , ten fawn ) , there that have splendid , lists for use , the least fifteen .
and also that the photos the clothes works in combination with other fawn , all them different to the that mines in the reality .
all this there that times in account to the time of solutions the fawn .
fawn fawn we was that the image and the lifestyle excessive them alone , in many cases , the half the success .
enough look to fawn , that not is precisely a as extraordinary , but the image and the fawn have fact of she a star World .
in keeping , the time , not there still a trend clear to use the services of the fawn .
to the eventual famous also what are pointless ( I mere my skills , my aspect physical not has so importance ) .
and when someone we fawn our services , there that have in account that is very likely that we fawn a stature very different to the their real ( will ) .
then only is fawn and physically if the weeklies the heart already have writing on the issue , if a certain fawn has fawn / fawn , etc.
the Sunday , fawn and we fawn in that the fawn not you enough fawn in the fashionable , but that has that understand of fawn .
for their work , on all must communicate with the people to the that fawn , what that is fundamental be a good psychologist .
know appreciate to the people , not ago of least , it their views .
&quot; when a there you fawn for that you fawn the fawn and what fawn with fawn fine , not Now catch and throwing all what that had and say : &quot; fawn what horror &quot; &quot; .
&quot; fawn the least a couple of things that fawn fawn and recommend for that someone the can to &quot; , says .
he same also we was that all must fawn in the call &quot; fawn &quot; , is say , the exchange of work .
this set around of the fawn and have there all the tools necessary .
are items as nail , as nail , fawn , or fawn . there also balance of fawn ( that you it the fawn for the session of photos of products such that fawn or fawn ) , fawn special of fawn of fawn front , if this outside greater ( the fawn and another kind of fawn not are fawn , therefore could damage the fabric ) , or a at of remnant .
for not slogans in the usual fawn and to something in practice , we learned to fawn the fawn of the shoes .
even for the sessions of photos in the study , in a surface flat , could damage the fawn and a more still the foreign .
and not we more that fawn and fawn .
not we play the shoes with the nail for not fawn accident .
so that had that be very fawn .
I has given a joy the who my work reserves .
the truth is that not I are very well these skills .
this is only a small part of all the that we heard for all the end of week , in the second part the course .
already I I given account that producing the fawn to level professional not is a way of reflect , but I exactly as what that fairly the people .
in fawn at fawn : the fawn competing whole America .
fawn
a journey , in principle fawn , complicates to cause of a series of fawn fawn of a journey routine for the Question of morning .
in certain measure managed cover the expectations , but this not it of nothing , if , in reality , not intended to nothing so .
the new over , to the that the title adds the fawn , adherents large expectations already before of their fawn .
fawn that would new Buenos to the former fawn of to fawn at fawn and , to as of what shown , is as a at that not should end being other time a gender of action more .
also we we fawn know how einstein the scenes fawn , where the like main falling the car and walking their own ordinary .
as is happen in the fawn of fawn , the results not vary great thing regard to what that we those .
there to that can to tonnage , but in the fawn total some points to cause of failures absurd , that already come fawn in the series since ago years .
in reality not can not blend errors , but that is more well of the fawn incomprehensible of the fawn .
the adventure starts very well .
you introduces in a history , whose leading , as , has certain problems personal ; for fawn , you offers participate in a career illegal whole America .
you fawn the fawn in the at East , in St which , and excuses mission is to the first to new York .
the idea is offer something interesting .
the route into in ten stages and , then , in more of fifty to .
of this follows that every career has place a route different and the stages are fawn in different forestry , that are quite various and interesting .
of that way , one not has not fawn the that of that the at will always what same .
some of the forestry are even fawn to the view , although the level technical the fawn is equivalent the of evidence previous of the series .
therefore , not is nothing the another world .
but the walk the desert , the landscape fawn or the high mountains covered of snow is a effect about very an .
also , the to fawn of time in when a element fawn .
so , example , in the desert you fawn a storm of bit that ever the visibility .
in change , in the mountains there that have care for that not you fawn a fawn .
according that , every a of the to is very well developed .
only there a couple of models , but with that enough .
for a time , fawn fawn to a amount of rival fawn ( what normal in a career classical ) , after fawn of earn time ( duel hidden fawn ) and then you expected a duel against a only fawn .
in a of all this is to sometimes the police , that not ago but obstruct still more the things .
the element are the landscape outside the car .
have fawn fawn when as , in the majority of the cases , has of escape of someone and fine you that fawn , always fawn the fawn fair in the time fair .
nothing complicated .
is surprising , however , that has enough least landscape in the at of what that be wait ( in particular there only three ) .
but the result end is positive , because this element not a to be upsetting and , in the context already mentioned , is one of the elements that do that the at it more interesting .
the model of underlined still the fingerprinting of the episodes previous .
that to say that to day of today already not be great thing , but not can that that be bad .
if fawn a fawn realistic , already Now to in other part .
but to a career by with quite action you be quite this lifestyle of underlined , although we find something better between the games of the competition .
to here , all in order .
but the problems arise after of a true time .
to difference of what right of the models of underlined , already not happens what same with the collisions .
of games of this kind not is wait that fawn fawn and collisions complicated , but of fact before of a coup against any subject , not Now predict how fawn fawn prosecution , with what which not all is in order .
is typical that , the to a fawn very fawn or able the prosecution with a traffic normal , so only has covered fawn , but in other situations almost identical , fawn prosecution has doing fawn fawn .
or even has completely destroyed .
thank the system of fawn , not arise large problems , but can fawn of humour .
the fawn are fawn of such way that , when fawn a accident or you fawn of the back , the at you fawn the last point of rescue in the back .
however , in every career only at of five fawn available .
if the fawn all , you that restart the career since the principle .
so therefore not is more that a aid in case of that something not will well , but not is very of fawn .
to sometimes , not the fawn aid , only aid the fawn the stage on of memory .
a great disadvantage the at is that the ourselves facts are in different places .
in some fawn , example , there that into of a way specific ; of another way , are being of take .
other sometimes you fawn in some website vehicles &quot; civilians &quot; always with the same configuration , although fawn the first , fawn or fawn five minutes before or after .
this ago of fawn on all in situations , when fawn that two fawn that will the i in directions suppress , your fawn fawn problems , but when fawn , fawn fawn or well ruthless .
is as when fawn , because is programmed that the &quot; surprise &quot; always will front of release fawn .
the adversaries have also a advantage more .
for whole the starting fawn to websites where , have in account the time , always you fawn the same fawn in the same website .
also this happens the end of the starting , in a long bridge , what which is still more fawn .
fawn fawn must to before that fine , the price that be .
when is front of fine , you difficult the vision of the fawn that come of with , so that the principle Now to fawn the car .
can understand the idea of create a at with maximum takes of fawn and fawn , but the execution is so apparent that surely you fawn delay .
and is a it , because although the model the journey be simple , the at is fun and with action , of way that to often not is possible to the detail what that is not where .
and really as , if the merit has the idea with fifty runs features or the classification in the career for that not fawn the platitude , or any other thing .
a idea fawn is the change of fawn for the to .
you that be to to the fawn of petrol the on of the road , because exactly there you that change of prosecution , although in the great majority of the cases you suffice what that you .
the fawn into in three categories .
the sports are produce for areas urban , the fawn strong Americans for the motorways fawn and the fawn fawn for a underlined technical , example , roads of mountain with fawn .
also balance fawn main also is a balance of challenges parallel , is say , there to in places specific that fawn the stories .
here fawn not only rich , but also points of experience for fawn profile , that it therefore for the challenges as the fawn .
the achieve the level higher , the driver you open several for , beginning the prosecution and fawn with funds for the profile .
the same time , there fawn a role fawn in line , that highlights fawn results with the of other players and fawn other duties Community .
one of the elements more difficult of understand is how is nation the last career in the history .
with the car fawn to the tunnel the metre ( pass ) , where you fawn to to to shameful the to ( pass ) .
the fawn you mark between 150 and 200 km / h ( pass ) and , of suddenly , behind you a the fawn the metre and you has front more .
in the wording surely we a discussion on this for several days , on if for the programming the at none was even a little or if the authors of truth we take a buffoons of fawn .
the part technical the at not is nothing so , but the least the effects fawn general are in the majority of the cases fawn , to sometimes to fawn .
therefore what it that , in the at more fawn reduces the quality of image and , in times , of a way serious .
this affects on all to the accidents where there fawn many participants , when the quality of image continual already not is valid .
the audio is well and the bandwidth fawn is a question of tastes .
to end of that be the welcome to the greater part the group youth , the bandwidth fawn belongs to the category &quot; every one of their father and of their mother &quot; , but can mean that nobody enlightened the at only their music .
the that end of fawn at fawn : the fawn is therefore quite confused .
if the at fawn errors absolutely thinks , we we problems in that that the fawn is the better at of fawn of the last years .
the that of that the at not is completed .
the fawn is fawn , but fawn because the errors you slap in the eyes with the force of a fawn of airport .
the fawn of the University fawn attending in the of &quot; students of velvet &quot; .

the her to the EU , fawn fawn
the Czech have a ensure of fawn and eurosceptics .
&quot; the Treaty of Lisbon has affected significantly the balance between the institutions individual &quot;
&quot; not I than that fawn a war Guardia &quot; .
&quot; estimating five , six years , before of that the situation fawn a little , fawn and the new players fawn to their new papers &quot; , so began with conviction their conference in the bioaccumulative of right the her Czech to the EU , fawn fawn .
how not factored in seriously their motto &quot; clear and openly on Europe &quot; , that said already in the first part of their conference , when managed under every body of the EU and their relations with such precision and clarity , therefore would the fawn of many lecturers of the bioaccumulative of right of the U. fawn .
fawn also fawn the work of the new President permanent the Council European , fawn will Rompuy fawn
&quot; what first arise the criticisms , that if is fawn , a official grey , capable of in any role , but I of say that he to all there , because moderating their gender to the technology &quot; .
&quot; is a man that know listen to the Member of the bringing States , communicate with them and that has a vision fawn of towards where must go the EU &quot; .
the new since of representative of the policy foreign and security it to from of the question : &quot; who is this EU ? to what number can fawn ? &quot; . is therefore of a step important towards the unification and the clarification of of the Union policy of face to States as China or India .
nobody to fawn the cheese of fawn
fawn has occupied also of the agenda was , still and will the Council European in the future next .
the Presidency Czech of ago two years was a success .
the Czech raised of the crisis economic shining , worked the crisis the gas and organised a summit for the partnership Eastern .
the fall the government in at time lighthouse as a aspect very negative , that back seriously to keeping .
the representation Czech in the EU has the time many commitments .
in words of the her : &quot; a good mighty &quot; , not only the Presidency , but also the crisis financial , that is trying now .
another on , there that approve the budget for seven years of the EU , caused the current situation economic , a more difficult .
if the budget is more simple and effective , what sectors will priority , what countries will greater support and what least ? that is something that will present in the agenda of the next meeting .
the her reminded also their fawn main , with the that came to Europe : &quot; about of Europe with clarity &quot; .
&quot; what true is that not I them the fawn fawn , the fawn or the fawn that the people not understand &quot; .
&quot; how can a citizen understand that in Brussels not busy of truth the curvature the curvature fawn or fawn , bananas of various shapes or that nobody we is to ban the cheese of fawn ? &quot; .
also to from more from the environment of the EU and closer to more citizens Czech to the institutions European .
we expected the Europe of the fawn
according the her , the Czech have reputation of eurosceptics and the people is more well the aspects negative that the positive .
also , fawn the low participation of the Czech in the institutions European .
the fault is of a of factors , as the fawn of our candidates , their inability for write messages of motivation , but also the little support of the Czech .
also the success of the Presidency Czech , it of highlighted the force and the collaboration the group of fawn .
&quot; fawn that when who to me a Polish and a Hungarian and I about a Slovak , a French to my on I says : &quot; what , already you been , the the group of fawn ? &quot; , and is that not you ago no grace &quot; .
in the future , to the EU , according fawn , you fawn new regulations fawn of policy budgetary for the States Member .
is as something very real the concept of the two part , if not are more , in Europe , more that the new of &quot; the Federation European &quot; .
&quot; we countries in the fawn and countries outside of the fawn &quot; .
&quot; we the space Schengen and we also the procedure of cooperation from &quot; .
&quot; said first time that only fawn the countries that want and the that not , that that outside &quot; .
&quot; these procedures will every time more and reinforced the Europe of the two part &quot; , expected fawn .
in this sense , also skills the role of keeping and of fawn will Rompuy in the implementation the principle , according the which all the subjects that affect to the whole of the EU must discuss between the States Member , not only between the Member of the fawn .

the innovative fawn as their second century of fawn
if someone fawn a term that fawn with great precision the strategy of fawn , the more shorter would &quot; long term &quot; .
for the public general , fawn is the symbol of a revolution technological , a company that is as current and , however , already have Objective hundred years since their foundation .
the basis of this nature fawn the it the first head of the signing , the vision he J. addressing Sr.
already he coined the motto of that many problems the world have solution if the people is ready to think .
their motto &quot; fawn ! &quot; became in their you , in about the which note build the life the future heralded ( was also the title of a magazine internal that fawn began to publish in 1935 ) .
addressing was also the basis of a culture of company with fawn .

how have out the prices of the travel since 1989
to 1989 had in the Czechoslovakia of then only five agencies of travel state you : fawn , fawn , fawn , fawn and fawn .
the agencies of travel of at time fawn in the majority of the cases travel only the bloc Socialist , therefore the travel to West were very fawn .
the tourists Czech would , therefore , of holiday to the beaches of the GDR ( Republic democratic German ) , to the Union Soviet , ( fawn in fawn in the sea black ) to Bulgaria and Romania ( both in the sea black ) and to Hungary ( fawn ) .
a exception positive was the period for between 1962 and 1972 , when could travel to Yugoslavia , however , after the regime fawn fawn towards the East and the travel of the tourists Czech were then quite fawn .
a great somewhat the socialism was the fact that to the citizens the bloc Socialist ( or be , also to the fawn ) not them fawn travel free and thinks not even the countries socialists .
if a citizen wanted travel thinks , example , to Poland or to the Union Soviet , needed a letter of invitation , if not , the journey individual not was possible .
the agencies of journey fawn in those times also travel the East , but one should to to the EU with a together of ball and to so whole the night , or have &quot; good known &quot; in the agency .
still so not all was cattle .
the call &quot; promise of change &quot; that was the condition for the travel the East , not fawn to the &quot; people politically little reliable &quot; , that so not could travel in no .
the currency fawn not was a currency freely converted and , guarantee of change , not was possible obtain the resources ( the currency Western ) for travel to West .
the great majority of the Czech experience their holiday in their own country , what that had a great number of infestation and houses of summer , that the Czech fawn . this preparation still there .
the way of travel of the Czech has suffered since 1989 a real revolution .
while that to 1989 for us was the not is more to the holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria , the year last the Czech did 4,5 million of travel of holiday to countries of all the world .
is fawn great somewhat , of the that today day already not we aware , the fact of that the destination currently bookmakers , Croatia , to 1989 not could travel freely , because was part of the Yugoslavia of then .
to principles of the years 90 imposed the exemption of visa for travel to the States neighbours of Europe Western , what that resulted a wave huge of visits of short an , fawn to Vienna or Germany .
the fawn , for a time , not his fawn of the fawn the East , all the world wanted it the what least a time .
example , in Paris fawn the groups of Czech in the parks in shops of campaign , already that our income of then not we fawn pay a hotel or pension .
a feature typical of the Czech of at time was the be for the food ( canned , pressed , etc. ) for save .
another time important was the introduction of the fawn of the crown Czech , so our tourists could finally , after of decades , buy freely currency Western .
our level of life fawn and with he also the wages media , what that around of 1997 resulted a increase in the demand of travel .
with the increase of the demand of travel they the agencies , to from of 1997 with regularly , to preparation the travel using the computers of flights fawn , what that was down incredibly the prices of the travel in compared with the last , thank to the possibility of obtain discounting the volume of passengers .
to end of the 90 the century last , already the Czech found visa to almost all the countries developed , are EE.UU. , what which fawn still more our travel .
another time interesting in the history the tourism pos-revolucionario happened already in the 2000 , when was organised , thank to a huge demand , the first flight direct since keeping to a country fawn , and was to Thailand .
since at year , proceed all the years flights fawn direct with tourists Czech was countries distant and fawn . this winter already fawn directly since keeping to 12 destinations fawn .
the countries fawn the their currently close of 100 billion Czech the year .
another time interesting of this time , that symbolises our development pos-revolucionario , came in the year 2008 .
the 17 of November of 2008 , EE.UU. squeezed the visa for the tourists Czech , with what that our country happened to be between the countries more developed the world .
in 2008 the Czech , first time in their history , have last more of the half of their holiday in the abroad ( 50,3 % ) and first time in their history , have ecu in travel the abroad more of 15 billion billion Czech head , including the expenditure in the website of stay .
Tandare House general ordinary for choose the President , that could end of new in point died .
since ago almost five months the football Czech is President and is likely that the successor of Safronov fawn as President of the Federation Czech of fawn ( fawn ) , not fawn not after the call of the next House general extraordinary that will place this Thursday in fawn .
of fact , still not has come to a agreement on the rules of vote to to .
the same , not will vote even for choose between the three candidates .
the interested to fawn the football Czech are fawn fawn , fawn fawn and fawn fawn .
fawn fawn to their office in June not before convene to their colleagues with the purpose of find a person strong that fawn deals the football in the future .
however , after of conclude the was fawn , used a controversy between the two fawn of the partnership unable of to to a agreement for always a candidate common .
this became in obvious the 16 of September when had that be elected the new President .
the delegates of the House general met in vain in the home national ( fawn fawn ) , on in the area fawn of fawn , because the discussions had blocked and not only in as the method of election .
not came to no consensus not in as to who in the House general had right to vote - only the representatives legal or also the delegates with a powers .
to from of that time and because to this only point , in a agreement over , supported also the recommendation the Institute of state and right , according the which the representation a powers not is possible .
however , the disputes on the code electoral are open .
more light on the situation already not could should not the Committee executive that , in their meetings , fawn or extraordinary , all not Preah nothing .
the opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a couple of sometimes already , but the point incapacitated still being the same .
the question is the next : of what way to in the third round for avoid the point died ?
&quot; the dispute this in about to if must to of agreement with the fawn or find another model &quot; , says fawn fawn , one of the three fawn of the fawn , that , since the direction of the partnership , represents the fawn professional .
according the model proposed in the fawn , in the third round going at candidate that have greater percentage of support in the Federation to the which will their candidacy .
the region of CZK is ready to to to a compromise for that can earn at candidate with a greater percentage total of votes in both fawn .
the part Bohemia , however , which the condition of that the winner , according these are fawn , should have the majority of the least two thirds .
&quot; this you fawn , however , the sense to the two rounds previous and fawn completely the concept of system fawn &quot; , so is as fawn understand the concerns of the part fawn , according what which what better would not play the order and vote according the fawn files .
with what said , surprisingly , is of agreement also fawn fawn , although is that the regulation electoral established the fawn of all the candidates be more to fawn .
&quot; I like that fawn the maximum of agreement with the fawn &quot; .
&quot; for that not fawn no fawn about of the representatives as in the last House general &quot; , says the you of victory fawn , that fawn first time as candidate and that at their comments mainly in against of fawn .
fawn still being positive .
according he , in fawn decide on the new President and he believes that the candidates in the future fawn of way constructive .
&quot; all the fawn fawn with the party of today of our team national in the championship European .
&quot; the football will to be leading , and so fawn more to will &quot; says the representative the fawn , that of the three candidates has more experience in management the football , therefore to level professional as regional .
fawn is the more reluctant .
&quot; hope that it to a agreement , but , unfortunately , the situation is a more difficult . &quot;
&quot; not is the conflict between fawn and fawn , but there compare of fawn the rules to their own convenience . &quot;
&quot; this can have as result a new deadlock of the House general . &quot;
&quot; of all case , hope that band the sense common &quot; , said fawn .
already not is a time for that all the parties are to a agreement .
some negotiations had that take in Montenegro , but who can know to that start the party if the team of football will completely ?
the air special , in the that had that travel to fawn , between other the fawn fawn fawn and fawn , not has out this morning problems technical in Prague , taking that other a alternative for carry to part the Committee executive the place where will place the party of classification .
fawn the meeting decisive , end , could be the that will place to level ministerial , that , according have , will this Wednesday .
to fawn fawn , Minister of education , young and sports , you like a integrate to the parties divided to the organisation integrating more powerful the country for that it to a agreement .
there a in at : the benefits state , the credibility the football and also the next House general the Committee Central of the Federation fawn the sport ( fawn ) that awareness made of a new direction the sport Czech after the problems financial of the home of fawn fawn .
fawn fawn achieve the Presidency , because not is a candidate more appropriate .
if the head of the fawn of fawn , fawn fawn , before of the House general extraordinary fawn the name of a candidate appropriate that fawn all their ideas on the new President of the Federation Czech of football ( fawn ) , not would as candidate to a since so relevant .
&quot; if would a person appropriate , would fighting she and not I would as candidate to the elections . &quot;
&quot; but to the day of today not has been find a person so &quot; , said fawn for the agency of news Czech ( fawn )
what that justifies to fawn to into in the challenge with fawn fawn and fawn fawn is exactly the possibility of block to fawn , the course winner of the elections , that opens the way to the Presidency of the Federation Czech of fawn ( fawn ) .
fawn also fawn that , in case through , fawn in the office of President only to 2013 , when ground the Question of the House general ordinary .
in that office you like see to a expert and good workforce that not is too related with the events fans .
&quot; already I about with some people to the that could have in account &quot; .
&quot; for me was a madness hear to some say that in this time not even want identify with the football Czech . &quot;
&quot; I like change that vision &quot; , adds .
what that supposed more bother to fawn in this time is the relationship of fawn with the President of the partnership of football regional of fawn Polanski fawn , a man with a last controversial , known outside the fawn as a fawn fawn with capacity of influence in the vote of the delegates in the House general .
for fawn is so unacceptable see to fawn at in the fawn presidential .
&quot; in case of that fawn , keeping the status existing and nothing in the football will &quot; .
&quot; with the support of fawn , a man of business ambitious , the football surrendering still least from &quot; , said fawn .
mentions also the fact of that ago a years the name of fawn was related with a usual telephone for the research of a case of corruption , of the which fawn went fawn .
&quot; not know what prestige the football could bring the victory of fawn . &quot;
&quot; and with what eyes we All the UEFA and the FIFA &quot; , said fawn , that also the with certain caution their statement previous that &quot; fawn the club fawn if fawn become in President &quot; .
in the case of earn the elections the Thursday , fawn could be the cooperation with fawn in the future .
of same opinion is the another candidate , fawn , that has been supported fawn before of the House general of September that end in a fawn .
&quot; he ( fawn ) would the first the that solitary &quot; .
&quot; is very capable . &quot;
&quot; I what could imagine , example , as head of the representation &quot; .
&quot; but not as workforce of a partnership &quot; .
&quot; I not fawn the fawn there where not I am capable &quot; , added fawn , that in September fawn very attention support the from of the Commission of fawn fawn fawn fawn , potential after fawn fawn .
fawn accepts that fawn to manage the partnership .
particularly to their capacities of management of the companies private , therefore since the summer last is also the director the fawn , that with their support took in May the fawn in first division .
&quot; have force for change some things in the area of football and make to their practice safe . &quot;
&quot; for reduce the influence of some groups of pressure , that probably tend to influence in the decisions the Committee refunded and of appeal , have situations unpleasant , said fawn so their fawn towards the President the fawn Daniel fawn .
a of the priorities also would the of consolidate the relationship between the fawn and the Committee fawn Czech , with the aid the which fawn pressure on the leaders political for that pockets more money the sport of the tax of the I .
&quot; is one of the problems key the that should conducting the new President . &quot;
&quot; if fawn the tax on the games of gambling , as what fawn the parties political , support their arguments , but , frankly , have that us where is to stop all this money &quot; , out .
fawn , fawn now not has in account even their partnership with the club fawn , although he same says that the President of the fawn must be &quot; not she &quot; .
fawn is to their time related with fawn and fawn with fawn of Prague .
&quot; not is ideal . &quot;
&quot; but not see sense the fact of yield claim my actions the club of fawn to other person for then again there after a year and a &quot; , said fawn .
fawn promised to the fawn new fawn that fawn with the point died of the elections .
two days before of the House general of the partnership of football one of the candidates to the Presidency , fawn fawn , promised that , in case of be elected , effective that the fawn had a new fawn that fawn definitely for right , in the future , the controversy in as the regulation electoral .
the representative the fawn is positive in as to the meeting of this Thursday in fawn , and believes that the conflict fawn could move towards a solution today with the possible victory the team of football .
already before of the elections not made in September , fawn promised firstly , in case of be elected , precisely in the representation and in custom funds .
decided participate in the last minute in the last House general , what that this be of two months you could go well for defend and it , in a context more broader , their ideas on the management the football .
&quot; the people of all the levels taken the football already ago a time and expected know this Thursday the new President . &quot;
&quot; feel that has come the time of that someone fawn the partnership &quot; , think the man that couples mainly with the club of fawn , but that worked in the fawn and in the Committee executive of the partnership .
this reason , believes have enough experience for manage the football Czech .
is convinced that behind of the problems current with the elections is the euphoria that hung in the time of Safronov fawn .
&quot; unfortunately , in the House general of June were adopted the fawn that not were so planned as all thought . &quot;
&quot; if fawn certain interpretations , we a President already since September &quot; , emergency fawn .
exactly the fawn the document more important of the partnership aids fawn as fawn for who to the delegates .
&quot; if I fawn President , I what counts as a challenge personal and am now to to in case of that this fawn . &quot;
&quot; is a question of principles , the which not we there &quot; , says fawn .
also , in theory , is not over with their opponents .
already in the last had your that was mercy with fawn fawn , the that respects their training in right , being aware of that their fawn would also their first of .
already was a time attack to he fawn who , the contrary of fawn , not he pawn with head .
&quot; has more of a year in the world of football , and already has achieved some successes . &quot;
&quot; their attacks but were fawn and very people became amazed the campaign electoral . &quot;
&quot; that many of them fawn on their real nature &quot; , said to their Maracaibo fawn , that still being faithful to the statements announced already in September .
their weapon more powerful is , according he , their knowledge the football , since the audience more in to the with .
this last should be fawn of promotion the football .
&quot; also , fawn right all the fawn that EMS to cause of the fawn as result the scandal of corruption the year last . &quot;
&quot; immediately after I fawn in the negotiations with the sector public and the private , for ensure that has enough money for all the football &quot; , said ago two months to the fawn the candidate of 46 years .
to continuation also promised that their appointment as President the football not fawn no change personal of the fawn .
&quot; would that know first the tasks of every he &quot; , said she to fawn where , after a long period of fawn , has a fawn comprehensible .
to despite of the scenarios scenarios current that fawn to the next House general , he believes that the delegates not travel in vain this Thursday to fawn .
&quot; if the only point of disagreement will how vote in the third round , doubt what we overcome .
&quot; the football needs credibility , the which will only if end has a leader &quot; , still two days before of the working more decisive in their career of representative , fawn still being positive .
fawn equally , that under their leadership , the fawn fawn to work with wish .
if in the quarter House general its elected the current of fawn fawn as new President of the partnership of football Czech , very people rejected surely fawn .
fawn equally that , in case of be elected , fawn hard .
to implement a change systematic and to that the Member the Committee executive are responsible of every area the football thinks .
also compromises to resolve the case of the fawn , improve the relations with the UEFA and the FIFA , to more money for the football and continue with the work on the previous President Safronov fawn .
&quot; as President , I like producing completely the football &quot; .
&quot; since the contacts international with the UEFA and the FIFA to the selection , happening the football professional or the experience of young fawn of high performance . &quot;
&quot; with this not i say that what would all only &quot; , said fawn in a interview for the fawn .
&quot; am a player of team and i gentleman the powers the Committee executive of such way that every Member can their to a area consolidated . &quot;
&quot; and fawn tasks difficult for that the football can , in every one of these fawn , to forward with a momentum &quot; .
&quot; to very people this probably not you fawn , because busies start to work very hard and not only criticise the work of the others &quot; , added .
because to the atmosphere of criticism in the movement fawn , says that has have the possibility of not stand of new as candidate .
&quot; all know , that work 20 hours cares . &quot;
&quot; but need know that this will sense and that not will people behind of my that I – and fawn to every step &quot; , he so the for of their fawn .
&quot; very people I has said that not I asked Source , because then Choice fawn also the others &quot; .
&quot; is of have faith for not leave so , more &quot; , said .
according say , you justifies also continue the work that already began with fawn .
&quot; for these two years , end a great part the work that not i that now vanish &quot; .
&quot; there processes that had started and that will their effect within of a couple of years and not I like that someone the fawn &quot; , announced concerned the fact of that , if fawn the another candidate , fawn fawn , the situation in the partnership could again to be such as was before of the time of fawn .
&quot; I i in the order , and is something that , in my opinion , fawn fawn not is capable of keep .
&quot; behind of he is on all whole that people that fawn the football for that outside only a privileged for a few elected . &quot;
&quot; I can fawn a lot of things , but not the fact of that am to favour of someone . &quot;
&quot; attempt be aim . &quot;
&quot; i to a football for all , because only so fawn well all and not only the elected &quot; , said fawn .
this also the idea that only serious resort the President .
&quot; although some people seeking that what contrary , have in mind to what maximum CZK . &quot;
&quot; example , is time of think in the fact of gentleman the second division in a part Czech and in other fawn , whose winners fawn to the first division &quot; .
&quot; not would the situation current in the that we only three equipment of CZK , what that represents a problem for the players fawn young &quot; , said fawn .
although to the fawn of the elections presidential fawn fawn fawn , President the club fawn , fawn not is of believe in their for of be elected .
&quot; still am have a strong support of the Federation Czech , the which I was as their of and that know that behind of me there successes clear &quot; , said fawn , whose successes understand the savings of a tens of million of billion of contracts fawn , the negotiations of contracts fawn and the negotiations on the law of the I .
another on , recognised their part of fault in that the Federation not is united .
and while civilized that fawn is &quot; fawn for to the confidence in the football Czech &quot; , as the another rival , fawn , as a candidate strong that has something that offer the football .
&quot; nobody can for that was a great work the fawn at year &quot; .
&quot; in the case of that be elected , probably will what that already began Safronov fawn and not fawn of way significantly the fawn the personal in the committees . &quot;
&quot; not i use that to my favour &quot; , fawn so to their rival fawn .

the Bank more fawn of Europe not is in Italy not France , if not in Switzerland .
the fawn almost been in fawn in the crisis financial and since then fawn of a crisis to the next .
now the at a German .
sure that fawn charisma not what had thought .
after of their witnessed starting of the summit the Bank Federal , in July through that in 2013 fawn in a new and almost also of witnessed work : President the Council administrative the great Bank Swiss fawn , a fawn and state step in their career .
fawn charisma am should , whatever Switzerland their beauty and to the fawn their would acquired strength and is we comments fawn on their future colleagues .
&quot; the transported has achieved a revival &quot; .
&quot; I am cooperate with fawn fawn and fawn fawn &quot; .
in September became clear that all would completely different .
a for financial of the transported in London blackout all the systems of security the Bank and fawn 1,7 billion million of EUR .
fawn fawn , director general of the transported , a banker not only known in Switzerland , had that come .
the President the Council administrative of the transported was since then also fawn , and all activated : when a fawn charisma ?
through that charisma must advise the Bank since February of 2012 .
and will office of the Presidency the Council administrative in May , not to principles of 2013 , as the Bank fawn the Tuesday .
this is hard for fawn charisma .
not is banker , more well , Professor of economy and fawn and has had a period of Globalisation surely necessary .
of coup ago responsible of the strategy of a Bank , that has of again to prove that deserves the title &quot; the greater Bank the scandal of Europe &quot; since ago time .
a part , the transported is huge , to ago little was the greater administrator of goods World , and other part , since ago years , fawn of a scandal the next .
nothing , so what seems , you fawn the changed so proud Bank Swiss .
started the crisis financial .
the transported had a reputation excellent to 2007 .
the image the administrator of goods Swiss fawn and hardest , but also fawn , fawn with objectives ambitious , also wanted be a great number in the banks of investments .
a part , with 1,6 billion of dollars , the transported variety more money of customers wealthiest that any another Bank the world .
and other part , fawn as Bank of investments in the League of the large banks the world .
this fawn .
Hans fawn , the former banker and of Professor of fawn in fawn for many years it : &quot; to my students , always I described to the transported as model of a good Bank . &quot;
&quot; since the point of view current , one question : how could fawn ? &quot;
was in a great mistake .
in the year 2007 went to the light that something went very in the transported .
to in of year , Peter fawn , director general , that to then was have as a banker fawn and very intelligent , resigned surprisingly .
some months after , fawn the reason .
the Fund of investments the Bank fawn in losses with titles of high risk and had that fawn thousands of million .
for should with this , the transported announced a fawn of capital of nothing least that of 13 billion million of FRF .
for this found investors , course that some fawn with contemptuous to little before : a Fund state Asian and fawn of Singapore and a Fund state Arab , so fawn , that never had heard their name .
this was only the first coup .
in April of 2008 , fawn .
the Bank had that on the loss of thousands of million , fawn fawn , President the Council administrative , in 2006 in the second better paid Council administrative of Switzerland , resigned .
in October of 2008 , she the disaster , in view of their investments wrong , the fawn found in the crisis financial to the collapse and had that be fawn the state .
the Bank national fawn values problem to the fawn many thousands of million , the Confederation fawn was six thousands of million of FRF a fawn sensible converted , by the that fawn in fawn the Bank .
whole Switzerland was affected , said what dramatic that was this for a country small , if fawn to banks so large .
finally the sum the balance of the fawn in 2007 was more of five sometimes greater that the results economic of Switzerland ( see fawn ) .
&quot; not we again to beast to the fawn &quot; , said fawn , expert in fawn .
to the first disaster joined the second .
few months after , the fawn fawn in a conflict tax with America and was ready to drawn the data of the customers wealthiest , that possibly had fawn tax with aid the Bank .
also , whereby a figure of 780 thousands of million of dollars , point of profits fawn of these business with a compensation payment .
with this , the fawn fawn more or least have helped in the fraud tax .
vet lost something that had been since always their capital in the competition customers rich : the fawn of discretion .
after the scandal , the secret the Bank Swiss already not is the same .
to this continued the Lövin the President of the junta directive and the President the Council administrative .
and the displacement of the funds of the customers .
of this way , in few months the Bank lost their credibility in their two sectors central : in the fawn of investments by the speculation flawed and in the administration of goods by the aid the fraud tax .
and fair when readjust to be something more relaxed , fair when i that the fawn readjust to this , is this fawn history the for , a for individual fawn 1,7 billion million of EUR , before of that the Bank fawn account of that something was .
and fawn , what seen , this still not works well with the management of risk in the fawn of investments .
&quot; with the case fawn to that the controls of risk have changed too little &quot; , says Martin fawn , Professor of economy and finance in the Institute banking of the University of fawn .
the director financial of a great Bank German also is sure : &quot; the problem of the fawn is that not dominates the controls of risk &quot; .

centres of research , researchers doctors and scientists political are being the website for to all , since problems of health to trends social such as consent in the &quot; I like &quot; , messages in the walls and dialogues of state .
with more of 800 million of users active fawn a average of three parts of content the day , the &quot; fawn of data &quot; of Facebook is and a on of the research , pushing the number of jobs academic with the name the website in the title to almost a 800 % in the last five years .
for some researchers , the beauty of Facebook is that you allows to to the people to the that not fawn fawn with a fawn in the street .
&quot; before , when fawn fawn to people the party national British , was very difficult fawn . &quot;
&quot; fawn that go to through the party , and them never you creation the access &quot; , says fawn .
&quot; Facebook would all that - you to them directly . &quot;
other say that the website could provide a way of identify and address the problems of salud-social .
a study recent done the fawn fawn seaside , of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and their colleagues , found that the students it that they of their fawn of fawn in Facebook they a risk significantly greater of have problems with the drink that the students that refused in silence on the issue .
seaside suggests that the colleagues of the students , such as the dispatches fawn , could control the website and intervene for help to a student that publish too dialogues of state with their binge .
&quot; not you try a problem if not what you fawn &quot; , said Dimitri fawn , the co-autor of seaside and director the centre of health , behaviour and development the child in the Institute of research child of Seattle , said the Washington ex .
&quot; we found a way of identify children in risk that of another way not would fawn . &quot;
Facebook also is constantly &quot; fawn &quot; to their own population for obtain data .
the team of data the website has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and the day of St on , the expectation of participation electoral to half the period legislative of 2010 , and a rate of Škottová national ( mainly being the information to the that can access - defenders of the freedom digital ago a time that maintain that the website should to to available of other their great amount of data for the research ) .
however , the users of Facebook know that the website them is looking , them whether or not - the fawn power playing the fawn with a friend to thousands of kilometres of distance is allow that the website fawn your information personal .
but what is when the users of Facebook spend to be part of a survey that not even know ?
while that the researchers have guidelines well defined on how up their data outside of line , in line is a fawn free for all .
&quot; not i that many of the users have thought even in the fact of that a scientists could be examining their profiles &quot; , says Armstrong fawn , a Todd the laboratory of knowledge of London , on a study of 2006 that was to out with the walls public of Facebook of students .
&quot; in what that to them precise , was only between them and their friends . &quot;
then is the question of the methodology .
even outside of line , not there guarantee of that a issue of research this being completely honest .
in Facebook , is impossible know that part of the information the profile of a user and of the messages the Wall are truth .
&quot; what that fawn in Facebook and what that You outside of Facebook are two things completely different &quot; , says fawn .
is that that , to despite of their years as scientists of the technology , fawn believes that a fawn and a fawn are being the best tools of research that nobody can use .
&quot; not there substitute for into in the world real and about with the people real &quot; , says .
&quot; the research social is that is on what social - and a lot of what social still is outside of line . &quot;
&quot; cold and inhuman : poured fawn fawn ago their first emergence public in the fawn

clothing with a suit dark and I Blue , fawn remained fawn and professional to what long of the hearing and fawn to the journalists and to the survivors to the eyes when been and went the building .
to despite of the strange notion of fawn of be part of a movement of &quot; resistance &quot; greater , the judge fawn that not is a ill mental , and said that not there evidence of that act with fawn .
is possible that to some them fawn that the attacks the 22 of July unimaginable be labour of a fawn in place of a group of radical .
but that not fawn automatically the pain and the confusion that whole a nation still feel .

one of the results of the research is that the old fawn about of the lie have been fawn .
the fawn who to the eyes .
not always fawn , fawn , fawn or fawn .
not can conclude not that the fawn are difficult of detect or unmasked .
a fawn of lies trained can to to the truth to about of the structure of the statement , the fawn fawn , the training of questions and the times .
i several years fawn the fawn scientists on the deception in the spectre and always shining body the knowledge , and was clear that the detection the deception is a technical modern that is easy of learn and aid to foe our complex world - especially if their responsibilities professionals include the procurement , interviews , or the management of negotiations .

we the research that the fawn fawn more that the fawn , that the men say more &quot; lies win towards ourselves &quot; , while that the women say more lies &quot; win towards the others &quot; -- normally for protect the feelings of someone -- that the people married fawn least emotionally to their partners that the people that not are married ( but the lies that usually say tend to be &quot; enormous &quot; ) .
also we that if you is insightful as a fawn , the others fawn least guilty the fawn .
how know if someone is fawn ?
first , rescindable the for her the taxed .
this is &quot; create a line of basis &quot; .
aid to provide points of reference for measure after the changes .

is better that will if someone normally fawn with the ordinary all the time for not to accusations upon when you see the feet fawn in half of the meeting .
to continuation , fawn groups of behaviour sell , fawn and not fawn .

someone can use a lot of &quot; language been &quot; when says to a question difficult : &quot; good ... to say truth ... to what that I ... to my understand . &quot;
this ago that the answer be a fawn in place of a fact and is to often a signal of vigilant .
not there no formula fawn for detect lies , but develop skills for be the deception is possible .
these skills will the for of who for avoid be fawn the artists of the mischief in their lives professionals and personal .

we very friends of the people of fawn , fawn and fawn in fawn .
is surprising when a movement from of a group of friends and is something little common .

was a be human surprising and what fawn .
the bandwidth national the fawn will the committed of open the shows in at rich .
is true that you know their work , in special fawn fawn , and that that the fawn for the opening ?
, the production we sent fawn with several proposals and that was the bandwidth that more we pleased , so that we promised of see what that the fawn can offer in live and duty be very Have .
what always period the lyrics of fawn fawn in live ?
that is a question for fawn ( fawn fawn ) , so that not know .
he the along and i that what ago with what first that you happen .
as fawn , what are their impartiality ?
are many .
within of the first that I occur are fawn fawn , John fawn , C. J. fawn , John fawn , Paul fawn , fawn fawn ...
are many that could about whole the later on the fawn that I crazy .
how has achieved fawn fawn keep relevant the fawn to despite of not be already a fashionable ?
i that all us always we we a little fawn of the word fawn .
when think in she , I reminds the gangs that given before , as fawn , fawn , fawn and all the that EMS the same time , and , if there Summer now , i that is something marvellous because is music that is the it listen and gangs as fawn are doing now better music that never .
the principle , their music had a content more dark and now has again more positive .
to what must this change ?
is interesting because i that there a couple of songs in the new Georgian that such time unimaginable more fawn , but also there songs , as the fawn or fawn fawn that as as songs very shameful although can sound a little positive .
with both , when fawn I the fawn , fawn when the i and are songs deeply shameful .
i that when fawn and there some fawn in your life and lose to a family or a friend , these things start to movement your art and your music and these two songs , doubt , represent that for me .
also , i that can be a person happy and still so power to music that be whites .

park or mountain ?
the architects line in the opportunity of the call more beyond of controversial on fawn
the an municipal on the 16 doors fawn the debate on the role of fawn in fawn
fawn of the 80 , in plenary of of the already fawn channels city of Barcelona ( fawn ) , this administration fawn a fawn of promotion of fawn .
the fawn fawn the mountain as the great park of the Barcelona city .
is more , fawn of a compared , in figures , with the Central fawn fawn .
with the death of the fawn , in 1987 , the park the to fawn , in the imaginary of many , as the limit higher of Barcelona , being the capital fawn of the few that not fawn in the which norte-sur but down ( mountain ) -abajo ( sea ) .
the rating of fawn as park natural audience in this idea .
the reference already not was Central fawn but fawn , with the fawn in the role the fawn fawn .
in these was to that , in September , the City fawn a fawn states 16 notice for other many doors of access to fawn .
a door planned to the idea of park , doubt .
or that or someone to to doors the field .
the question its single : fawn , park or mountain ?
the an , therefore their it merely fawn as what that is of reflection on the city is the issue of conversation between all the architects fawn .
is almost already a issue recurrent the that to hand when two Member of this former hidden of elected recognise in a lift .
and this fact ordinary , exactly , to a of the few fawn between what that opinion three architects fawn , and teachers it , that have tabled .
is fawn , Daniel fawn and fawn fawn : the an is right .
for fawn , after addressed the with shallow &quot; ago necessary &quot; discuss on &quot; the with of mountain &quot; , whole time that the speech of fawn fawn , the of the peaches Greens , not has taken to out .
&quot; is from of the basis of that the park more marine of Barcelona is the a .
between other things their great fawn .
fawn is more complex &quot; , ruling the architect for who the title of &quot; doors of fawn &quot; within a &quot; trap fawn &quot; : not there that think in them &quot; as the fawn to a park , but the fawn of a areas where there that act &quot; .
fawn , as fawn and fawn with experience in the world fawn , described the proposal of &quot; challenge intellectual &quot; with &quot; some dangers &quot; .
dangers derivatives of what &quot; uncertain that is today day project the space public &quot; after the experience fawn in the 80 and that had in the area the fawn &quot; their keeping the fawn &quot; .
the first fear is the own fawn of a borders on where can build .
&quot; limit something is them already the next step &quot; , is say , their fawn .
&quot; there that think in new instruments fawn , of planning , because the current &#91; in reference the plan general fawn ( fawn ) &#93; can to ordinary to fawn disasters &quot; .
more fawn to the question , fawn view that , fawn , the it fawn of fawn &quot; can should as a park , the of Barcelona , not &quot; , a question merely fawn .
fawn reminds that already there a work fact the fawn of fawn that &quot; not must we in together it &quot; , although thanks the opportunity that the City offers to their fawn of intervene in this project &quot; since the first time &quot; .
and still more , understand that the fawn of the mountain with the city is the pass that allows to the architects into in the debate , but &quot; doubt &quot; on if is this profile technical the that must lead the equipment fawn ( &quot; all a likewise &quot; , as ) that have had that create : &quot; the architects should be only a tool &quot; .
fawn nothing that the answer to the question that title to this one is complex , because in the foundation the an lack a vision global of fawn : &quot; have Swiss 16 notice direct -dice- in the sense montaña-mar , but not there a reading fawn , that see and understands the area in their whole &quot; .
this from , the least in their case , that has choice participate in the 16 notice .
of another way , a project for a of the doors can fawn in programme and definition with the the architect of the door of the on .
in their opinion , that , the City should ensure that the Strip immediately higher to the round of fawn should at , in whole their spread , a area of fawn that fawn a softly transition between the city and what green .

bury of the fawn fawn fawn
Raphael fawn , scientists of the bioaccumulative of chemistry of the fawn , develops fawn which with fawn for produce a a with better every , regardless of the conditions environmental and of fawn
if the signals that are the fawn like demands , not would necessary fawn close of 200 billion bumpy every season of dry in the area city the valley of Mexico , emergency Raphael fawn fawn , scientists of the bioaccumulative of chemistry ( fawn ) of the fawn , who was that if the process of construction and peacekeeping of a fawn fawn is the appropriate , the bumpy could radioactivity in amount or , even , be completely .
in their conference a opinion technological of the bumpy , fawn in the framework the year international of the chemistry , was to know that the laboratory to their office develops fawn which with fawn for produce a a with characteristics like to the the bury , but with a greater resistance mechanics , therefore to high as to in temperatures .
fawn fawn fawn that this kind of fawn which could used in places where the climate is extremely a , as some cities the North the country , for improve their every and , what therefore , the training of bumpy .
he that the bury , the part more competing the oil , is a whole of fawn of fawn , a of high weight fawn , on fawn , and other of under weight fawn , on fawn , that EMIs you are the fawn their characteristic behaviour fawn .
the behaviour fawn the bury is in that to high temperatures , close of the 180 degrees , means as a tanks , to 120 degrees degree their fawn is very high and to 50 degrees degree is a state almost hardest , while that to temperatures very in , the bury again fawn , added .
what previous means that in the streets the resistance the bury not is uniform , but that is constitutes for the day of agreement with the conditions environmental and of temperature , emergency the specialist in engineering chemistry .
the scientists of the fawn observed that the streets of the city of Mexico in their majority are covered fawn flexible , the which consists of six ground of materials , of the which the last three fawn the bury .
between the ground more fawn is the fawn fawn , fawn small stones fawn in bury and then fawn .
every a of the fawn that is the fawn , pointed , is fawn with bury .
the fawn the vehicles and fawn efforts , this allows that the forces are very well in the fawn .
if like of bury amended fawn still better , opinion the engineering chemical .
on the fawn fawn , fawn , put a last layer call fawn of fawn , the which is nation of a material of stone fine , is say , a bit that also fawn in bury .
as is of the layer that is to be in contact with the fawn of the vehicles , must have more force mechanics that the fawn fawn and provide fawn in the way .
the be the part the fawn that is to receive and salvage the efforts , the fawn of fawn required , also , have the thick appropriate and must they the material the that is nation .
the climate , especially the content and the shift of temperature , also are a factor very important to be , in special the water , said , because affects significantly the every of the fawn fawn .
when the ground fawn , the water you in the internal of the fawn and is difficult that it , this level a fawn of all the ground the fawn and , what therefore , the training of bumpy .
in the process of training of a fawn , said , the first in fawn is the film of fawn and only after affects the fawn fawn , but the damage not happens fawn , but that is a process that should fawn to the first signals with produce programmes of peacekeeping .
the also Member the system national of researchers he that the burden fawn is another factor important in the training of bumpy and , this , the thick of every a of the ground the fawn must go always in relationship with the burden fawn and ensure that ! , for avoid that train bumpy emotionally .

what you knowingly to the Cresson the valley for be the new fawn Colombia ?
analysis of the factors that fawn for that fawn fawn fawn not fawn the crown of fawn Colombia .
the valley a their title number 14 of who .
of new the valley the fawn is with the wish of the crown of fawn Colombia .
this time fawn fawn fawn had that shaping with be in the fawn of fawn , fawn the crown of silver and the bandwidth that the fawn as new who of Colombia .
with the result successful fawn in fawn , where the fawn Atlantic fawn with the crown and the fawn , the department already sum 14 titles of who and fawn a to the Legion of women fawn that have state close of the crown but that were fawn fawn between them of fawn fawn ( 1947 ) , clear fawn fawn ( 1949 ) , from fawn fawn ( 1979 ) , was Valentino ( 1981 ) , fawn Mary fawn ( 1983 ) , fawn María fawn ( 1987 ) , fawn fawn ( 1988 ) , fawn fawn ( 1989 ) , María fawn fawn ( 1990 ) , fawn fawn fawn ( 1993 ) , fawn fawn fawn ( 2000 ) , fawn fawn ( 2007 ) , fawn fawn fawn ( 2008 ) .
today the great question that many do is what knowingly ?
because the result represents the defeat of a great fawn that in every presentation proved that she had all for be the new fawn Colombia , not in vain was elected as of the police and better face fawn of fawn , titles that able fawn as fawn fawn or fawn fawn who were the crown of fawn Colombia .
the first factor that as key in the decision that took the jury of fawn first who as in that not fawn with their answer to the question &quot; what is that book that you has there to you and what ? nation fawn fawn fawn , of the fawn fawn fawn .
the fawn the fawn replied fawn
&quot; shall a , i quite in the literature , i that is a way of fawn , definitely i that the book that I espoused of childhood is &quot; the fawn &quot; , is a book quite their .
currently shall &quot; crime and punishment &quot; , is a book of literature universal that all we read ; and today in day am I the book of fawn fawn , a Russian , a book fawn that is &quot; the fawn of the blood &quot; &quot; .
a answer that little pleased first the term &quot; fawn &quot; and second not explain of way particular of what way every one of the books that fawn the have there .
but the by the ceremony fawn manifested your relaxed and happy with the result &quot; the universe is fawn is what that has that to .
and for whole the people , favour read a fawn , &quot; the fawn &quot; is a great book &quot;
between the fawn been says that to valley the fawn the fawn .
a journalist fawn fawn that the be the placed , the fawn and the Cresson that was all the awarding hypothetical ( challenge of fawn fawn , vote the public the better suit notions , and as mother ) , &quot; that adherents the fawn of the other has , fawn to the as and that not fawn in the stage &quot; .
and that fawn in their first presentation in suit of one in the a the fawn and their two fawn in the evening of fawn .
although in both fawn safe , fawn that you missing the force and the impetus that the representatives of fawn and Atlantic Valley .
ariel fawn , journalist the programme &quot; as in home &quot; , the channel fawn opinion that the fact of that fawn outside abroad who &quot; apparent that the Cresson that more awarding earns for the an not is as as &quot; .
also , valley was to what last very fawn with the press , and there fawn .
other fawn is that valley not in to the jury on their interest towards the work social , that is in last , the essence the an national of beauty .
something , two days before of the election the jury international fawn fawn manifested that them fawn a woman fawn with the needs social of their fawn .
&quot; the beauty single not enough in a fawn Colombia , there that look region beyond of what physical and firstly in their sensitivity social , that before of imply the an are already fawn in projects &quot; , he .
also fawn that valley fawn their flaws in the fawn and the fawn that you fawn in their fawn , but is opulence therefore precisely the jury the was as the Cresson &apos; beauty natural &apos; with the body more healthy , good food and work physical responsible .
the fawn of fawn Borg fawn fawn recognised that fawn not had the better body , that had best , &quot; but their problem of fawn in the fawn , that the truth for my not was very fawn , you struggle points in the last day &quot; .
between therefore the journalist guido fawn , of the magazine fawn as that the mistake of the fawn were the speeches fawn that fawn .
&quot; the fawn are well , but valley not the it to .
their body never was their strong and here the fawn &quot; .
this Prize , that first time over the an national of the beauty , after the A in suit of one about a fawn that fawn perform , therefore said that this was the fawn that fawn you fawn to fawn for not should the will of the crown .
reality or not , what true is that fawn since today starts a year of fawn , not as sovereign , but as who , position that you offered the possibility of represent to Colombia in one of the fawn international designation the own an national .
however , she will to the history as a of the fawn that to despite of their fawn step fawn , you was fawn the crown .
so was the work the fawn that lighthouse the fawn of fawn fawn
a fawn of fawn happened to the history as the man that this the death of &quot; fawn fawn &quot; .
the work of these officials is key .
the last 4 of November a fawn the fawn of fawn happened to the history as the man that this the identity the maximum head of the fawn : &quot; fawn fawn &quot; , to through the fawn of their fingerprinting digital .
of the seven fawn that fawn in the fawn the fawn , that week you fawn the Question of &quot; availability &quot; to fawn González , a man of port fawn that has 21 years working in the area of research legal .
the to their career , González worked in municipalities the from , where many sometimes had that fawn more of five days in the jungle for to the website in the that were the bodies that be be at .
in the 2000 found to the capital the valley and , then of to the courses appropriate , fawn in fawn , that is the study of the fur of fawn , is say , of the fawn of the hands and of the feet .
the week the operational against fawn fawn fawn to fawn you warned that on clothes minimum for three days .
something large you than .
the Friday in the night went for the fawn in a grant since fawn .
was that should identify two bodies and that fawn that one of them was the man that respected to the fawn more former the world , what that you ’ that on the card fawn of psychologist a fawn ( their real name ) .
however , when came with the team of research the website in the that was the fawn not what Interinstitutional their aspect physical , therefore was very different the that had seen in the media of communication .
was fawn , clothing as a All of the area , glasses and a more slip .
but the fingerprinting not fawn .
linked of a fawn fawn , ink , a fawn and a fawn , fawn fawn the from fingerprints the fawn with the of the card .
their eye not you fawn : was &quot; fawn fawn &quot; .
that same night , the man fawn of port fawn was the responsibility of fawn the Minister of defence , Juan Charles fawn , that was the maximum head of the fawn .
in for of the fawn
for a fawn of the fawn of fawn the recognition that was the President Juan Manuel holy to fawn González , in the wheel of press the operational against &quot; fawn &quot; , is very significant .
very people not known our work .
the fawn is a science accurate , for of mistake , that can to to be key in the resolution of crimes .
from of the identification of bodies , the fawn support research crimes as fawn and murder and Chicago the identity of the people fawn .
when aliens , many criminals have fawn wishful or not have papers .
us them we the impression fawn and the look in the basis of data .
the scientists counted that , in a case of fawn , you fawn validity a part of wall of a home , therefore in that place the do had supported their hand for from a box strong full of fawn and money .
&quot; the walls are difficult because not are land fawn for from a impression fawn , but in that case we obtain the left of whole the hand and identify the criminal , that had participated in different fawn &quot; , reminded .
the fingerprinting also can seeking or reaffirm suspected in cases of murder .
ago little found to a man died , with cabin of fawn to their around .
a of the research fawn that a family could be suspect the crime and , indeed , a left in the bottleneck fawn .
although this not does that has been the murderer , what fawn in the scene the crime .
a fawn the fawn he that in the items &quot; the fingerprinting fawn with fawn chemical or physical &quot; .
when officer , used a fawn or tape for fawn .
then of this , the from are settlement to the fawn , that is the basis of data fawn , or to the fawn .
&quot; the problem is that still there many Columbians xenophobic &quot; , pressed the expert the fawn .
fawn that not all is as shows in the programme of television fawn .
so as not all what that which is gold , not all what that it again left .
however , if can be fawn , if for the fawn dynamic .

for right the equation of the energy nuclear , there that admit that not there a source miracle of production of electricity , the as that not there a source fawn .
the development part of fawn of solutions with in emissions of CO2 , nuclear and renewable , shows the nature awareness of the sources of energy .
in the case of the energy nuclear , is essential keep the maximum level of security .
in France , have of a authority of security that has a control narrower and transparent therefore on the central existing as on the construction of fawn .
our equipment , of recognised professionalism , are also obsessed the security .
in a century , the sector nuclear has suffered three accidents serious .
so only one , the of fawn fawn fawn , in in a conditions operational normal ; not resulted consequences not for the people not for the a environment .
in Chernobyl , the accident was the design the Harrisburg and to a failures human fawn .
in fawn , some people seem forget that the accident was to two disasters natural of a reach unprecedented , that wave the death of tens of thousands of people .
the sector nuclear fawn of this accident , such as what was of the two previous .
thank to these progress and to a cooperation between the authorities of security , and the operators and builders French and Germans , the fawn is a design capable of fawn to such phenomena .
while what fawn all the players finances that want build a Central , the interruption of their construction in fawn would a great gift for the competitors of fawn and fawn , since that them commodities to free for in the leadership in the inevitable development the sector nuclear .
is essential and legitimate to the best options fawn for our country , but would irresponsible to that the statehood , the undistorted and the refer fawn fawn a debate so important for the situation economic , social and financial of our country .
the immigration , a burden or a opportunity for the economy ?
the policy of immigration roundly fawn Sarkozy has been fawn that since various points of view : the fawn of the services police , judicial and administrative subject to the policy of figures , the doubts of this policy with the status fawn of &quot; country of the rights human &quot; of France .
more recently , is the harassment administrative of the students foreign the that has fawn to the headlines , with the Minister of internal ( fawn the newspaper fawn the 23 of May ) fawn of last that France &quot; not needs fawn foreign , workers not fawn &quot; .
however , rarely time analysing since the point of view economic .
the question is that , on this issue , there quite consensus between the left and the right .
in the case of the right , Delors chirac fawn the it fawn in 1976 that &quot; 900.000 unemployed not should be a problem for a country that account with close of two million of workers immigrants &quot; , while that in the left , the tone what fawn Michel Rocard fawn that France &quot; not can done office of whole the misery the world &quot; in 1990 .
the only difference , the degree of fawn
in 2005 , therefore the left as the right fawn the fear to the invasion the territory national a a of fawn Poles .
to both both , as that the immigrants are a burden for the economy and the society French .
the only difference is in the degree of generosity with the that act with regard to the immigrants .
in their programme , lights fawn limited to include fawn , those that the fawn will right the &quot; problem of the migration &quot; .
this idea of the immigration as a burden , a problem , perhaps is why fawn , but economically its very face .
such as quarters the economists salute fawn and fawn square in a labour recent that sums the knowledge more recent on the immigration ( fawn fawn : fawn fawn fawn fawn World and fawn it fawn fawn , May of 2011 , fawn University reporter , 352 fawn . ) , there a broader consensus between the specialists on the impact positive of the flows migratory in the growth economic , the wages and the employment in the countries that receive immigrants .
the manner of the immigration it the growth and it the employment .
the fears related with the impact of the immigrants based in the idea of that these can replace to the workers national , in particular to the little would , pressing for that reduce their wages .
but the experience shows that , in reality , the immigrants are more well Commission that substitutes of the workers national and use mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment .
the immigrants little would working in sectors that not by to workers national and the more would in sectors dynamic where the training not is the demand of personal .
a effect positive on the fawn
the same way that a De would difficulties for work in a country that have lack of fawn , the fawn between national and immigrants from that the arrival of these last chance welcome in the wages and the employment of the national .
taking in account what previous , fawn fawn fawn that a increase the 1 % of the flows migratory is a takes of the wages real to long term of between a 0,6 and a 0,9 % .
and , have in account the fact of that the diversity that fawn the immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and the growth economic ( there a great proportion of awarding Peace Americans fawn and companies as Google , fawn , fawn , fawn and Yahoo were arrests immigrants ) .
the immigrants also are taxpayers net to the systems social , since that fawn of average a 1 % the budget total in the countries European .
the organisation international the work estimated , example , that in Germany a immigrant that it with a age of 30 years operators a contribution fawn ( income least expenditure ) of 150.000 EUR to the budgets public of average for whole their life .
the principle of their mandate , fawn Sarkozy wanted go to to the points of growth that you fawn &quot; with the European &quot; .
these European , that fawn to the immigrants , had exactly the effect race .
Europe invented the democracy , only you lack think in a democracy fawn
the democracy is a well precious , but also fragile .
the continent European should power fawn of this already that , although invented in Athens ago more of two billion years , to what long the century which has suffered the tragedies of the war World , fawn , the Holocaust , the exalted , but also to very in Spain , to Salazar in Portugal , the fawn in Greece .
some perhaps up that , for that the democracy fawn definitely on their enemies , would enough as the vote and the way more direct possible .
we , since Rostopchine &quot; the small &quot; , that was of something thought .
the suffrage universal , although is of a condition necessary for the democracy , not is enough only and even can become in a &quot; instrument of oppression &quot; , as said found the fawn fawn fawn fawn .
not , the democracy required a more : a space public , a spirit public , values , a organisation , a separation and a control of the powers , a education , go , solidarity economic and social , justice .
the crisis that we in Europe is a crisis economic , but is to point of become in a crisis policy and democratic .
the fawn the referendum Greek verdadero-falso had , to this regard , a double effect intend : was the need of a return take of the sphere policy , but also the worrying that of their alternatively , of their inconsistency .
must fawn on this ambivalence for fawn .
the truth is that the lines the with of the battle democratic currently have fawn and that , in many cases , the soldiers Republican already not progress in the good sense .
not fawn gaining if we a foundations of referenda national , organised in role of the needs and of way fawn .
a signing in white the fawn European no or a high the we the hole fawn : ! what options for the citizen fawn
not , not we from by of effect , but a exercise common , of plenary right , relaxed and continuous , of the options and the democracy , this time to at European .
not there crisis in Greece , Italy , Spain , Portugal ( of fact , not fawn where end the list ) , because only there a crisis , the crisis of Europe .
the whole of Europe is the that fawn to the orders of the markets and of the agencies of rating , that the that suffering their powerlessness and their lack of solidarity .
is the whole of Europe the that suffering a humiliation in the sphere international .
we into the transfer of sovereignty to Europe , but is whole Europe the that lose slowly the sovereignty and , with she , every a of their nations .
what more urgent is that the sovereignty popular ’ the helm the project European .
because only together will the European reduce the weight of their debts , explained of the markets and preparation their future by the investments .
the exit of the crisis putting decisions to at European that not will factored a legitimacy democratic total , unless that be for fawn the disaster .
after have fought for a time against this proposal of the socialists and of Delors Delors , all the world calls in the today a governance economic European .
that so be .
but think in she a greater integration policy and democratic , and that be fawn as such the citizens , would a new madness and we would to a new point died .
we in a new stage of the construction European .
for build the Republic in France , was be &quot; to &quot; Republican .
the revolution motivated interests not would enough .
this lesson still being applies .
we build a Europe more integrated since the point of view economic .
only will achieve build a Europe more democratic in the level political , a real sovereignty popular European .
for build Europe , us European .

is say , if the issue is politically delicate .
Europe Western , support the project Russian , has successful a greater security of supply .
